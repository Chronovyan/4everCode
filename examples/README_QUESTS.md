# Chronovyan Quests Documentation

This document provides an overview of the quest system in the Chronovyan learning game, explaining how side quests and main quests work together to teach programming concepts through narrative gameplay.

## Quest Structure

The Chronovyan learning experience is structured around a narrative-driven progression system:

```

...and so on
```

## Main Quests

Main quests form the primary narrative arc of each chapter. They:

- Integrate multiple programming concepts from side quests
- Present more complex challenges that build on previously learned skills
- Advance the story of Alex and CORA's search for Professor Thorne
- Unlock new areas, abilities, or game mechanics
- Typically culminate in a "boss fight" that tests mastery of the chapter's concepts

### Main Quest Structure

Each main quest document follows this format:

1. **Overview**: Basic quest information including title, chapter, difficulty, concepts, and prerequisites
2. **Quest Description**: Narrative context for the quest
3. **Gameplay Elements**: Environmental features and CORA's role
4. **Coding Challenge**: Specific programming tasks for the player
5. **Code Solution**: Example solution to the challenge
6. **Learning Application**: How the quest applies concepts from side quests
7. **Success Criteria**: How players know they've succeeded
8. **Reward Delivery**: What players gain upon completion
9. **Progression to Next Chapter**: How the quest leads to the next story beat
10. **Quest Flow and Integration**: How the quest connects to side quests and overall narrative
11. **CORA Dialogue Samples**: Example dialogue for immersion and guidance

## Side Quests

Side quests teach specific programming concepts in focused, bite-sized challenges. They:

- Introduce individual programming concepts in isolation
- Provide immediate feedback and clear success criteria
- Award code examples that can be referenced later
- Support the narrative by fleshing out the world and characters
- May be required or optional, depending on the main quest requirements

### Side Quest Structure

Each side quest document follows this format:

1. **Overview**: Basic quest information including title, chapter, difficulty, concepts, and reward
2. **Quest Description**: Narrative context for the quest
3. **Gameplay Elements**: Environmental puzzle and CORA's role
4. **Coding Challenge**: Specific programming tasks for the player
5. **Code Solution**: Example solution to the challenge
6. **Learning Outcomes**: What programming skills players will gain
7. **Success Criteria**: How players know they've succeeded
8. **Reward Delivery**: What players gain upon completion
9. **Connection to Main Quest**: How the side quest supports the chapter's main quest
10. **CORA Dialogue Samples**: Example dialogue for immersion and guidance

## Quest-Example Integration

Each quest is tied to specific code examples that demonstrate the concepts being taught:

- **Side quests** typically introduce a single concept through a focused example
- **Main quests** require combining and adapting multiple examples
- **Code rewards** from completed quests become reference material for future challenges

This integration is documented in `examples/example_mapping.md`, which shows how each example file maps to quests throughout the game.

## Quest Design Guidelines

When creating new quests, follow these guidelines:

### For Side Quests:
1. Focus on teaching a single programming concept
2. Keep the scope small and focused
3. Provide clear feedback on success or failure
4. Connect to the narrative through CORA's dialogue
5. Ensure the reward (code example) is directly related to the concept

### For Main Quests:
1. Integrate multiple concepts from side quests
2. Require adaptation, not just copying of examples
3. Include a significant narrative advancement
4. Provide multiple ways to succeed
5. Test understanding, not just memorization

## CORA's Role in Quests

CORA serves multiple functions in the quest system:

1. **Tutorial Guide**: Explaining concepts and providing hints
2. **Story Vehicle**: Delivering narrative through dialogue
3. **Feedback System**: Reacting to player code success/failure
4. **Code Repository**: Storing earned code examples for reference
5. **Skill Progression**: Gaining new abilities as the player advances

Her dialogue should be helpful but not provide direct solutions, encouraging the player to learn through exploration and experimentation.

## Contributing New Quests

When contributing new quests:

1. Follow the established structure for consistency
2. Ensure the quest teaches valuable programming concepts
3. Maintain narrative continuity with existing quests
4. Include realistic code solutions that work within the Chronovyan language
5. Write engaging CORA dialogue that fits her character
6. Update the `example_mapping.md` to include any new examples

## Quest Testing Guidelines

Before finalizing a quest:

1. Verify that the code solution works as expected
2. Test that the learning outcomes are clear and achievable
3. Ensure the quest difficulty matches its placement in the game
4. Check that CORA's dialogue provides appropriate guidance
5. Confirm that the quest integrates well with the surrounding narrative
