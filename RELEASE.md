2. Apply fixes and update version:
   ```bash
   # Make necessary fixes
   git commit -am "Fix: [description]"
   
   # Update version in Cargo.toml
   # [package]
   # version = "X.Y.Z"
   
   git commit -am "Prepare X.Y.Z release"
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Version X.Y.Z"
   git push --tags
   ```

3. Merge back to main and develop branches
