## Build Issues

### Linking Errors with Unresolved Symbol
*Problem:**Build fails with undefined symbol errors such as `undefined reference to SemanticAnalyzer::SemanticAnalyzer` or`undefined reference to CodeGenerator::CodeGenerator`.**Solution:**
1. Ensure you've implemented the required methods in the appropriate files.
2. For standalone class implementations, make sure your class doesn't inherit from interfaces if you're not implementing their methods.
3. Check that your CMakeLists.txt correctly links all required libraries.
```cpp
    // Example of standalone implementation for SemanticAnalyzer
    class SimpleSemanticAnalyzer {
    public:
        SimpleSemanticAnalyzer(DiagnosticReporter& diagnosticReporter)
            : diagnosticReporter(diagnosticReporter) {}

        bool analyze(ProgramNode*program) {
            // Your implementation here
            return true;
        }

    private:
        DiagnosticReporter& diagnosticReporter;
    };
```text

###

. Ensure your method signatures match exactly what's expected by the tests.
3. Check for overridden methods that need the `override` keyword.

###

. Ensure all dependencies are properly included.
3. Fix any method signature mismatches.

## Runtime Issues

###

. Check resource allocation and deallocation within loops.
3. Ensure the loop exit conditions are achievable.

###

. Ensure proper resource allocation across threads.
3. Add checks for thread-specific environments.

###

. Implement the resource optimization algorithms.
3. Add debug logs for resource usage at critical points.

## Development Environment Issues

###

``text
    cmake -B build -S .
    cmake --build build
   ```text
2. Check that your compiler supports C++17 features.
3. Verify CMake version (3.15 or higher recommended).

###

. Enable verbose logging for resource tracking.
3. Configure your IDE to show temporal resources in the watch window.

## Common Errors

###

. Verify that you're using the correct method names.
3. Ensure classes implement all required interface methods.

###

. Add the `override` keyword to clearly mark overridden methods.
3. Check for typos in method names.

###

. Use explicit casting to disambiguate method calls.
2. Rename methods to avoid conflicts.
3. Check for unintended method overloads
