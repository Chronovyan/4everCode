# 4ever Tutorial Game: Development Roadmap

## Overall Goal
To teach the 4ever programming language through an engaging, story-driven RPG where the player (Alex, an intern) is teleported to Chronovya and must learn its ways (and language) to find the missing Professor Thorne and a way home. Throughout this journey, Alex is accompanied by CORA (Companion for Operational Rifting and Analysis), a utility drone from Thorne's lab that provides guidance, interface capabilities, and emotional connection while requiring resource management as a core gameplay loop.

## Prologue: The Lab Incident

### Setting
Professor Thorne's hidden research lab on Earth.

### Narrative Focus
Alex discovers Thorne's lab, his research into Chronovya, and the 4ever language. Alex experiments with Thorne's computer and encounters CORA, the professor's experimental utility drone. During the chaotic portal incident, Alex instinctively grabs CORA before being pulled into the rift.

### 4ever Concepts Introduced
- Basic interaction with the 4ever "terminal" (game's code interface)
- Variables: Declaration, assignment, simple data types (e.g., numbers, strings if Thorne used them for labels)
- Simple Commands/Functions (Syntax Only): Recognizing and attempting to use pre-existing commands

### CORA's Role
- **Initial Introduction**: CORA is introduced as Professor Thorne's assistant, a palm-sized drone that helps with his research
- **Initial Functionality**: CORA demonstrates basic terminal display capability and simple analytics
- **Narrative Purpose**: CORA provides contextual information about Thorne's work and foreshadows the importance of 4ever language
- **Example Interaction**: CORA helps Alex understand the terminal commands needed to access Thorne's research

### Code Example Mappings
- Maps to `examples/01_beginner/01_hello_world.4e`, `02_hello_world.4e`
- Also utilizes concepts from `examples/01_beginner/04_minimal.4e`
- Variable introduction maps to basic variable usage in `examples/01_beginner/03_hello_world_utf8.4e`

### Gameplay
- Environmental puzzles: Deciphering Thorne's notes to understand what variables to change or what commands to try
- Direct interaction with the 4ever code on Thorne's terminal
