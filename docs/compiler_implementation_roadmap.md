## Development Approach



The Chronicle Compiler will be developed using an iterative approach, with each phase building on the previous one. Early releases will focus on core functionality, with advanced features added in later releases.



Key principles:

1. **Test-driven development**: Comprehensive test suite for all compiler components

2. **Incremental development**: Start with minimal viable functionality, gradually add features

3. **Performance focus**: Regular profiling and optimization

4. **Documentation**: Thorough documentation of design decisions and implementation details

5. **Community feedback**: Early releases to gather user feedback



## Required Resources



### Development Team

4. Begin work on semantic analysis



## Conclusion



The Chronicle Compiler implementation roadmap provides a structured approach to developing a compiler for the 4ever programming language. By following this plan, we can create a robust, efficient compiler that fully supports the unique features of 4ever, particularly its temporal semantics and resource management capabilities.



The phased approach allows for incremental development and testing, with early releases providing core functionality and later releases adding advanced features. Regular evaluation and adjustment of the roadmap will ensure that the project remains on track and responsive to user needs.
