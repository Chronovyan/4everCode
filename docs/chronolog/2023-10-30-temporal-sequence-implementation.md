# TEMPORAL_SEQUENCE Type Implementation

## Overview

The TEMPORAL_SEQUENCE type has been successfully implemented as part of 4ever's custom type system. This implementation represents a significant advancement in the language's temporal data capabilities, providing a specialized collection explicitly designed for time-variant data.

Unlike regular sequences with temporal features added on, the TEMPORAL_SEQUENCE is built from the ground up to efficiently store, analyze, and manipulate data that varies over time. It provides native support for tracking values across multiple temporal cycles and offers a rich set of operations for temporal analysis and manipulation.

This marks the third major custom data type completed for the 4ever language, following the VECTOR and TEMPORAL_MAP implementations, and moves us closer to completing the custom type system.

## Key Features Implemented

### Basic Features
- **Time-indexed values**: Efficient storage and retrieval of values associated with specific temporal cycles
- **Chronological organization**: Automatic maintenance of time point order
- **Dynamic sizing**: Automatic growth and shrinkage of the sequence as elements are added or removed
- **Type flexibility**: Support for storing values of any type
- **Resource tracking**: Integration with the temporal runtime for precise chronon consumption measurement

### Temporal Operations
- **Cycle management**: Methods for adding, retrieving, or removing values at specific cycles
- **Range queries**: Ability to get slices of the sequence between cycles
- **Interpolation**: Multiple methods for calculating values between existing time points
- **Resampling**: Generation of sequences with regular cycle intervals
- **Pattern detection**: Identification of patterns and trends in temporal data
- **Projection**: Extension of sequences into the future based on detected patterns

### Functional Operations
- **Map**: Transformation of each time point using a custom function
- **Filter**: Creation of new sequences containing only points that satisfy a predicate
- **Reduce**: Aggregation of sequences into single values
- **Merge**: Combination of two sequences with various strategies for handling overlaps
- **Statistical analysis**: Calculation of temporal statistics on sequences

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The TEMPORAL_SEQUENCE implementation consists of the following key components:

1. **TemporalSequence Class**: The core class providing the sequence interface and temporal functionality
   - Located in `include/temporal_sequence.h` (interface) and `src/temporal_sequence.cpp` (implementation)
   - Manages time points with cycle-value pairs
   - Implements basic, temporal, and functional operations

2. **TimePoint Struct**: A simple structure representing a point in time with a value
   - Contains cycle number and associated value
   - Includes comparison operators for sorting and searching

3. **Integration Points**:
   - **Temporal Runtime**: Tight integration with the temporal runtime for resource tracking
   - **Custom Type System**: Registration of the TEMPORAL_SEQUENCE type with the type system
   - **Value Class**: Utilization of the Value class for type-safe storage

### Technical Highlights

1. **Efficient Time-Based Organization**:
   - Automatic sorting of time points by cycle
   - Binary search for efficient cycle-based lookups
   - Optimized range operations for slicing and querying

2. **Advanced Interpolation**:
   - Multiple interpolation methods (linear, step, spline)
   - Type-aware interpolation that handles numeric and non-numeric values differently
   - Edge case handling for values outside the sequence range

3. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Comprehensive statistics calculation for numerical sequences
   - Cycle-based and value-based metrics
   - Support for variance, standard deviation, and other statistical measures

4. **Pattern Detection and Projection**:
   - Simple pattern recognition in temporal data
   - Projection capabilities for extending sequences based on historical patterns
   - Framework for more advanced pattern detection in future versions

5. **Resource Management**:
   - Fine-grained tracking of chronon consumption
   - Operation costs scaled based on sequence size and operation complexity
   - Integration with the global resource accounting system

   - Time-based aggregations

## Conclusion

The implementation of the TEMPORAL_SEQUENCE type marks a significant milestone in 4ever's development, completing the third core component of the custom type system. This powerful data structure enables complex temporal data analysis with intuitive semantics, supporting a wide range of use cases from simple time series to advanced temporal pattern recognition.

With the completion of the VECTOR, TEMPORAL_MAP, and now TEMPORAL_SEQUENCE types, the foundation for 4ever's rich type system is nearly complete. The next focus will be on implementing the user-definable TYPE system, which will allow users to create their own custom types with temporal semantics.
