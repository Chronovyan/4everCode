# Resource Management in Chronovyan

## Overview

Chronovyan's resource management system is designed to handle the unique challenges of temporal programming, ensuring that temporal operations are performed safely and efficiently while preventing paradoxes and maintaining timeline consistency.

## Core Resources

### 1. Chronon

**Definition**: The fundamental quantum of time in Chronovyan.

**Characteristics**:
- Immutable and discrete
- Used for ordering events
- Represents points in the timeline

**Example**:
```chronovyan
// Get the current chronon
LET current = NOW();

// Create a specific point in time
LET future_time = current + 1h + 30m;
```

### 2. Aethel

**Definition**: The energy resource that powers temporal operations.

**Characteristics**:
- Consumed by temporal operations
- Regenerated over time
- Must be managed to prevent exhaustion

**Example**:
```chronovyan
// Check available Aethel
LET available = GET_AVAILABLE_AETHEL();

// Allocate Aethel for an operation
ALLOCATE_AETHEL(50);

// Perform Aethel-consuming operation
TIMELINE_BRANCH("alternate_reality");
```

## Resource Allocation Strategies

### 1. Static Allocation

- Fixed at compile-time
- Known resource requirements
- Most efficient but least flexible

**Example**:
```chronovyan
// Statically allocated buffer
DECLARE CONF::STATIC BUFFER_SIZE = 1024;
DECLARE CONF::STATIC buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
```

### 2. Dynamic Allocation

- Allocated at runtime
- Flexible but requires management
- Can lead to fragmentation

**Example**:
```chronovyan
// Dynamically allocate memory
LET size = calculate_required_size();
LET buffer = ALLOCATE(size);

// Don't forget to free!
DEALLOCATE(buffer);
```

### 3. Pooled Allocation

- Pre-allocated pools of resources
- Good for fixed-size objects
- Reduces allocation overhead

**Example**:
```chronovyan
// Create a pool of 100 events
LET event_pool = CREATE_POOL(EVENT, 100);

// Get an event from the pool
LET evt = POOL_ALLOCATE(event_pool);

// Return to pool when done
POOL_FREE(event_pool, evt);
```

## Memory Management

### 1. Ownership Semantics

- Clear ownership of resources
- Prevents double-free and use-after-free
- Enforced by the type system

**Example**:
```chronovyan
// Transfer ownership with MOVE
LET resource = ACQUIRE_RESOURCE();
PROCESS_RESOURCE(MOVE(resource));  // Ownership transferred
// resource is no longer valid here
```

### 2. Reference Counting

- Automatic memory management
- Thread-safe reference counting
- No garbage collection pauses

**Example**:
```chronovyan
// Create a reference-counted object
LET rc = MAKE_REFCOUNTED<MyObject>(arg1, arg2);

// References are automatically managed
LET another_ref = rc;  // Reference count increases
```

## Best Practices

1. **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**
   - Acquire resources in constructors
   - Release in destructors
   - Use smart pointers

2. **Temporal Locality**
   - Keep related data close in time
   - Minimize temporal jumps
   - Batch operations when possible

3. **Resource Monitoring**
   - Track resource usage
   - Set limits and quotas
   - Handle exhaustion gracefully

## Advanced Topics

### 1. Custom Allocators

- Implement custom memory management
- Optimize for specific access patterns
- Support specialized hardware

### 2. Resource Pools

- Manage groups of related resources
- Implement object pooling
- Reduce allocation overhead

### 3. Garbage Collection

- Reference counting
- Cycle detection
- Generational collection
