# Concurrency in Chronovyan

## Overview

Chronovyan's concurrency model is designed to handle the complexities of temporal programming, providing safe and efficient mechanisms for parallel execution while maintaining temporal consistency.

## Threading Model

### 1. Temporal Threads

- Lightweight, cooperative threads
- Scheduled by the runtime
- Non-preemptive scheduling

**Example**:
```chronovyan
// Create a new temporal thread
LET t1 = SPAWN {
    // This code runs concurrently
    FOR i IN 1..10 {
        PRINT("Thread 1: ", i);
        YIELD;
    }
};

// Main thread continues execution
FOR i IN 1..10 {
    PRINT("Main thread: ", i);
    YIELD;
}

// Wait for thread to complete
AWAIT t1;
```

### 2. Worker Pools

- Fixed-size thread pools
- For CPU-bound work
- Managed by the runtime

**Example**:
```chronovyan
// Execute work in parallel
LET results = PARALLEL_MAP(1..100, \i -> {
    // Expensive computation
    RETURN i * i;
});
```

## Synchronization Primitives

### 1. Temporal Locks

- Time-aware mutexes
- Deadlock prevention
- Timeout support

**Example**:
```chronovyan
// Create a temporal lock
LET lock = NEW_TEMPORAL_LOCK();

// Acquire with timeout
IF (TRY_LOCK(lock, 1s)) {
    // Critical section
    UNLOCK(lock);
} ELSE {
    // Handle timeout
}
```

### 2. Channels

- Thread-safe communication
- Buffered and unbuffered
- Select statement support

**Example**:
```chronovyan
// Create a channel
LET ch = NEW_CHANNEL<INT>(10);  // Buffer size 10

// Producer
SPAWN {
    FOR i IN 1..10 {
        SEND(ch, i);
    }
    CLOSE(ch);
};

// Consumer
FOR VALUE i IN ch {
    PRINT("Received: ", i);
}
```

## Temporal Consistency

### 1. Happens-Before Relationship

- Defines event ordering
- Ensures consistency
- Enforced by the runtime

### 2. Snapshot Isolation

- Consistent views of data
- Prevents temporal anomalies
- Supports nested transactions

**Example**:
```chronovyan
// Start a transaction
BEGIN_TRANSACTION {
    // Read consistent snapshot
    LET balance = GET_BALANCE(account_id);
    
    // Make changes
    SET_BALANCE(account_id, balance - amount);
    
    // Commit if all operations succeed
    COMMIT;
} ON_CONFLICT {
    // Handle conflicts
    ROLLBACK;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Minimize Shared State**
   - Prefer message passing
   - Use value semantics
   - Isolate mutable state

2. **Use Higher-Level Abstractions**
   - Prefer `PARALLEL_MAP` over manual threading
   - Use channels for communication
   - Leverage the type system

3. **Handle Errors Gracefully**
   - Timeout all blocking operations
   - Implement backpressure
   - Monitor resource usage

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Task Granularity

- Balance between overhead and parallelism
- Consider cache effects
- Profile and measure

### 2. Memory Locality

- Keep data close to computation
- Minimize cross-thread communication
- Consider NUMA effects

### 3. Load Balancing

- Dynamic work distribution
- Work stealing
- Adaptive scheduling

## Advanced Topics

### 1. Lock-Free Data Structures

- Atomic operations
- Memory ordering
- Hazard pointers

### 2. Software Transactional Memory

- Atomic blocks
- Optimistic concurrency
- Conflict detection

### 3. Distributed Computing

- Message passing
- Consistency models
- Failure handling
