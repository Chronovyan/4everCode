╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

I've discovered a fascinating aspect of Chronovyan technology:
their devices and mechanisms often operate on cyclical patterns.
By implementing this simple looping structure, I've been able to
automate resource collection and monitoring tasks that would
otherwise require constant manual operation.

// === BASIC LOOPS CODE ===

// Simple counting loop to process multiple items
print_to_cora("Starting collection cycle...")

// For loop that counts from 1 to 5
for (cycle = 1; cycle <= 5; cycle++) {
    print_to_cora("Collection cycle " + cycle + " initiated")
    
    // Simulate collection process
    resource_amount = cycle * 10
    print_to_cora("Collected " + resource_amount + " units of resources")
    
    // Track total collected
    if (cycle == 1) {
        total_collected = resource_amount
    } else {
        total_collected = total_collected + resource_amount
    }
}

print_to_cora("All collection cycles complete")
print_to_cora("Total resources collected: " + total_collected)

// While loop for condition-based processing
print_to_cora("\nStarting energy processing...")

energy_level = 100
processed_amount = 0

// Process energy until level drops below threshold
while (energy_level > 20) {
    // Each processing step uses 15 units
    print_to_cora("Processing energy: " + energy_level + " units remaining")
    energy_level = energy_level - 15
    processed_amount = processed_amount + 10
    
    // Check if we're getting low
    if (energy_level < 50) {
        print_to_cora("Energy level low, processing efficiency reduced")
    }
}

print_to_cora("Energy processing complete")
print_to_cora("Processed amount: " + processed_amount + " units")
print_to_cora("Remaining energy: " + energy_level + " units")

// Array iteration with a for loop
crystals = ["blue", "green", "red", "yellow", "purple"]
print_to_cora("\nScanning crystal collection...")

// Loop through each item in the array
for (i = 0; i < crystals.length; i++) {
    crystal_type = crystals[i]
    print_to_cora("Scanning " + crystal_type + " crystal...")
    
    // Different processing based on crystal type
    if (crystal_type == "blue" || crystal_type == "green") {
        print_to_cora("High energy " + crystal_type + " crystal cataloged")
    } else {
        print_to_cora("Standard " + crystal_type + " crystal cataloged")
    }
}

print_to_cora("Crystal scanning complete")

/*
These looping structures are essential for automating repetitive tasks
in Chronovyan code. I've identified three primary patterns:

1. For loops with counters - ideal for known iteration counts
2. While loops - useful for condition-based continuation
3. Array iteration - perfect for processing collections of items

The Chronovyan resource harvesters use similar patterns to automate
collection of crystals, energy, and other materials. I've already
implemented these loops to automate my research instruments.
