# Chronovyan Resource Management System



## Overview



The Chronovyan Resource Management System is a comprehensive suite of classes designed to track, analyze, visualize, and manage resources within the Chronovyan temporal programming environment. The system monitors key metrics such as Chronon usage, Aethel flow, Temporal Debt, and Paradox Risk to ensure stable operation.



## Components



The system consists of three main components:



### 1. ResourceTracker



The `ResourceTracker` class is responsible for collecting and storing resource usage data over time. It maintains a historical record of resource metrics and provides statistical analysis.



Key features:

- Records resource usage data with timestamps

- Maintains a configurable history size

- Calculates statistics such as averages and maximums

- Provides access to raw historical data



### 2. ResourceVisualizer



The `ResourceVisualizer` class generates visual representations of resource data collected by the `ResourceTracker`. It offers multiple visualization formats to help monitor and analyze resource trends.



Key features:

- Generates ASCII-based histograms and graphs

- Provides textual summaries of current resource state

- Creates detailed reports with comprehensive statistics

- Supports customizable visualization parameters



### 3. ResourceProcessor



The `ResourceProcessor` class integrates tracking and visualization capabilities into a unified resource management solution. It adds health monitoring, persistent storage, and simplified interfaces.



Key features:

- Monitors resource health against predefined thresholds

- Provides easy access to summaries, reports, and visualizations

- Supports saving and loading resource data from log files

- Offers a simple API for resource monitoring and management



## Usage



### Basic Usage



```cpp

// Create a resource processor with a history size of 100 entries

ResourceProcessor processor(100);



// Record current resource usage

bool healthy = processor.processCurrentUsage(

    chrononUsage,  // Current Chronon energy usage

    aethelUsage,   // Current Aethel flow

    temporalDebt,  // Current Temporal Debt

    paradoxRisk    // Current Paradox Risk

);



// Check if resources are within safe parameters

if (!processor.isResourceStateHealthy()) {

    // Take corrective action

}



// Get a summary of current resource state

std::string summary = processor.getSummary();



// Get a detailed report

std::string report = processor.getDetailedReport();



// Get a visualization

std::string visualization = processor.getVisualization();



// Save data to a log file

processor.saveToLog("resource_log.txt");

```



### Advanced Usage



```cpp

// Access the underlying tracker for more detailed operations

const ResourceTracker& tracker = processor.getTracker();

auto historicalData = tracker.getHistoricalData();

auto statistics = tracker.getResourceStatistics();



// Reset the resource history

processor.reset();



// Load previously saved data

processor.loadFromLog("resource_log.txt");

```



## Demo Application



A demonstration application is included to showcase the resource management system in action. To run the demo:



```

# Build the project

cmake --build .



# Run the demo

./resource_management_demo

```



The demo simulates resource usage over time, displaying real-time updates, summaries, and visualizations. It demonstrates how the system can be used to monitor resource trends and detect critical conditions.



## Integration



The resource management system can be integrated into larger Chronovyan applications by:



1. Including the necessary headers:

   ```cpp

   #include "resource_management/resource_processor.h"

   ```



2. Creating a ResourceProcessor instance:

   ```cpp

   chronovyan::ResourceProcessor processor;

   ```



3. Periodically updating with current resource values:

   ```cpp

   processor.processCurrentUsage(chronon, aethel, debt, risk);

   ```



4. Monitoring resource health and generating reports as needed:

   ```cpp

   if (!processor.isResourceStateHealthy()) {

       std::cout << processor.getDetailedReport() << std::endl;

   }

   ```



## Future Enhancements



Planned future enhancements include:

- Graphical visualizations using more advanced rendering libraries

- Real-time alerting system for critical resource conditions

- Predictive analytics to forecast future resource trends

- Integration with the Chronovyan IDE for interactive resource monitoring
