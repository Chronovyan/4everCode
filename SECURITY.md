## Supported Versions

Forever follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and provides security updates according to the following schedule:

| Version | Status           | Security Support Until |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|
| 3.x     | Active Support   | TBD (Next LTS)         |
| 2.0 LTS | Long-Term Support| June 30, 2026          |
| 1.x     | End of Life      | June 30, 2024          |

- **Active Support**: Regular security updates and bug fixes
- **Long-Term Support (LTS)**: Critical security fixes only
- **End of Life**: No security updates provided

## Reporting Security Issues

### Responsible Disclosure Policy

We are committed to working with security researchers to resolve vulnerabilities. We follow a coordinated disclosure model:

1. **Do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly
2. Report it to our security team (details below)
3. Allow us reasonable time to address the issue
4. Work with us to coordinate public disclosure

### How to Report

Please report security vulnerabilities to:  
**Email**: [security@Forever.org](mailto:security@Forever.org)  
**PGP Key**: [0x12345678ABCDEF01](https://Forever.org/security/pgp.asc)

### Required Information

Please include the following in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Any proof-of-concept code
- Your contact information

### Response Time

- Initial response: Within 24 hours
- Triage assessment: Within 3 business days
- Resolution time: Dependent on severity and complexity

### Bug Bounty Program

We currently do not have a formal bug bounty program but may offer recognition and swag for valid reports.

## Vulnerability Management Process

### 1. Triage
- Initial assessment within 24 hours
- Acknowledge receipt to reporter
- Assign CVE if applicable

### 2. Analysis
- Reproduce the issue
- Determine impact and severity
- Develop mitigation strategies

### 3. Fix Development
- Develop and test patches
- Code review by security team
- Prepare security advisory

### 4. Release
- Coordinate with package maintainers
- Release security updates
- Publish advisory

### 5. Disclosure
- Notify all affected parties
- Update documentation
- Public announcement

## Security Updates

### Update Channels
- **Stable**: Regular releases with security fixes
- **LTS**: Critical security fixes only
- **Nightly**: Latest changes (use with caution)

### Notification Methods
1. GitHub Security Advisories
2. Security mailing list
3. Official blog posts for critical issues

## Security Measures

### Code Security
- Static code analysis (Rust Clippy, cargo-audit)
- Fuzz testing (cargo-fuzz)
- Memory safety checks
- Dependency auditing

### Infrastructure Security
- CI/CD pipeline security
- Build artifact signing
- Secure package distribution
- Regular infrastructure audits

### Access Control

2. **Design**
   - Security design review
   - API security review
   - Cryptographic protocol verification

3. **Implementation**
   - Secure coding standards
   - Peer code review
   - Automated security testing

4. **Verification**
   - Security testing
   - Penetration testing
   - Fuzz testing

5. **Release**
   - Final security review
   - Build verification
   - Signed releases

6. **Response**
   - Vulnerability management
   - Incident response
   - Security updates

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Always verify package checksums
- Use signed releases
- Keep your environment updated
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Monitor security advisories

### For Developers
- Use the latest stable Rust compiler
- Enable all security-related lints
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use dependency locking
- Keep dependencies updated

### For Contributors
- Sign your commits
- Follow secure coding guidelines
- Document security considerations
- Report security issues responsibly

## Third-Party Dependencies

### Policy
- All dependencies must be actively maintained
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Pin dependency versions
- Maintain an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

### Audited Dependencies
- Standard library dependencies
- Cryptography libraries
- Network protocols
- Parser implementations
