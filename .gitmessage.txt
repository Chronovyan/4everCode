# Type can be:
#   feat     (new feature)
#   fix      (bug fix)
#   refactor (code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature)
#   style    (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
#   docs     (documentation changes)
#   test     (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
#   chore    (updating build tasks, package manager configs; no production code change)
#
# Scope is optional, but should be a noun describing a section of the codebase
#
# Subject uses imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
#
# Body explains WHAT and WHY, not HOW
#
# Footer should contain any references to issue trackers (e.g., Fixes #123)

# --------------------
# Remember to:
#   - Use the present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
#   - Use the imperative mood ("move cursor to..." not "moves cursor to...")
#   - Remove all these comments before committing
