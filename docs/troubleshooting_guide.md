# 4ever Troubleshooting Guide

This guide consolidates common issues and their solutions across different areas of the 4ever project.

4. [Common Errors](#common-errors)

## Build Issues

### Linking Errors with Unresolved Symbols

**Problem:** Build fails with undefined symbol errors such as `undefined reference to SemanticAnalyzer::SemanticAnalyzer` or `undefined reference to CodeGenerator::CodeGenerator`.

**Solution:** 
1. Ensure you've implemented the required methods in the appropriate files.
2. For standalone class implementations, make sure your class doesn't inherit from interfaces if you're not implementing their methods.
3. Check that your CMakeLists.txt correctly links all required libraries.

```cpp
// Example of standalone implementation for SemanticAnalyzer
class SimpleSemanticAnalyzer {
public:
    SimpleSemanticAnalyzer(DiagnosticReporter& diagnosticReporter)
        : diagnosticReporter(diagnosticReporter) {}
    
    bool analyze(ProgramNode* program) {
        // Your implementation here
        return true;
    }
    
private:
    DiagnosticReporter& diagnosticReporter;
};
```

### Compiler Test Failures

**Problem:** Tests fail with errors related to missing implementations or interface mismatches.

**Solution:**
1. Implement all required visitor methods in your custom implementations.
2. Ensure your method signatures match exactly what's expected by the tests.
3. Check for overridden methods that need the `override` keyword.

### Resource Optimizer Issues

**Problem:** Resource optimizer compilation fails with errors in `resource_optimizer.cpp`.

**Solution:**
1. Check for compatibility between the resource optimizer and other components.
2. Ensure all dependencies are properly included.
3. Fix any method signature mismatches.

## Runtime Issues

### Temporal Loop Execution Problems

**Problem:** Temporal loops don't behave as expected or cause crashes.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the loop condition is properly evaluated.
2. Check resource allocation and deallocation within loops.
3. Ensure the loop exit conditions are achievable.

### Parallel Execution Synchronization Issues

**Problem:** Parallel execution constructs lead to race conditions or deadlocks.

**Solution:**
1. Review synchronization points.
2. Ensure proper resource allocation across threads.
3. Add checks for thread-specific environments.

### Resource Management Errors

**Problem:** Resource leaks or insufficient resources for operations.

**Solution:**
1. Track Chronon and Aethel allocations with proper monitoring tools.
2. Implement the resource optimization algorithms.
3. Add debug logs for resource usage at critical points.

## Development Environment Issues

### Build Environment Setup

**Problem:** Build fails due to missing dependencies or incorrect environment configuration.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure all required dependencies are installed:
   ```
   cmake -B build -S .
   cmake --build build
   ```
2. Check that your compiler supports C++17 features.
3. Verify CMake version (3.15 or higher recommended).

### Debugging Setup

**Problem:** Difficulty in debugging temporal operations or resource issues.

**Solution:**
1. Use the Deja Vu Debugger for temporal debugging.
2. Enable verbose logging for resource tracking.
3. Configure your IDE to show temporal resources in the watch window.

## Common Errors

### "No matching function for call to" Errors

**Problem:** Compiler errors about no matching function calls.

**Solution:**
1. Check parameter types and counts.
2. Verify that you're using the correct method names.
3. Ensure classes implement all required interface methods.

### "Invalid overriding of virtual function" Errors

**Problem:** Compiler complains about invalid overrides.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure method signatures match exactly (parameter types, const qualifiers, etc.).
2. Add the `override` keyword to clearly mark overridden methods.
3. Check for typos in method names.

### "Ambiguous method call" Errors

**Problem:** Compiler cannot determine which method to call.

**Solution:**
1. Use explicit casting to disambiguate method calls.
2. Rename methods to avoid conflicts.
3. Check for unintended method overloads.
