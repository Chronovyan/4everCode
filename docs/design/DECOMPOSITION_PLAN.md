# Interpreter Decomposition Plan (WS-2023-07-001)

## Current Structure Analysis

The Interpreter implementation in Chronovyan is a monolithic class with multiple responsibilities:
- AST traversal and execution (via visitor pattern)
- Environment and scope management
- Resource tracking and optimization
- Type system integration
- Native function registration and execution
- Temporal operations handling
- Error management

The current `interpreter.cpp` file is approximately 3000 lines, making it difficult to maintain and extend.

## Decomposition Goals

1. **Improve separation of concerns**
   - Extract visitor implementations into dedicated files
   - Separate execution logic from environment management
   - Isolate resource handling into dedicated components

2. **Enhance testability**
   - Create smaller, focused components that can be tested in isolation
   - Reduce dependencies between components
   - Improve error handling and diagnostics

3. **Facilitate future extensions**
   - Make it easier to add new language features
   - Improve performance by allowing specialized optimizations
   - Enable better resource tracking and visualization

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Visitor Pattern Decomposition

1. Create dedicated visitor implementation files:
   - `ExpressionVisitor.cpp/.h` - For handling expression evaluation
   - `StatementVisitor.cpp/.h` - For handling statement execution
   - `TemporalVisitor.cpp/.h` - For handling temporal operations

2. Refactor the base `Interpreter` class to:
   - Maintain core state (environments, resources, etc.)
   - Delegate visitor method implementations to specialized components
   - Provide a cleaner public API

### Phase 2: Resource Handling Refactoring

1. Extract resource management into dedicated components:
   - `ResourceManager.cpp/.h` - Central resource tracking and allocation
   - `TemporalResourceTracker.cpp/.h` - Specific to temporal operations

2. Update visitor implementations to use the resource management components
   - Replace direct resource manipulation with calls to the resource manager
   - Implement proper resource cleanup and error handling

### Phase 3: Environment Management

1. Enhance the `Environment` class to handle more sophisticated scoping:
   - Add better support for closures
   - Improve variable lookup performance
   - Add debugging capabilities

2. Create a dedicated `EnvironmentManager` to handle:
   - Environment creation and disposal
   - Scope transitions
   - Global state management

### Phase 4: Testing Infrastructure

1. Create comprehensive unit tests for each component:
   - Test visitor implementations with mock AST nodes
   - Test resource management with simulated operations
   - Test environment management with various scoping scenarios

2. Add integration tests to verify components work together correctly

## Refactoring Approach

We'll use the following approach to ensure stability during refactoring:

1. **Extract and Delegate**: Create new components and delegate functionality to them
2. **Parallel Implementation**: Keep existing code working while developing new components
3. **Incremental Migration**: Gradually move functionality to new components
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test at each step to ensure behavior is preserved

## File Structure

```
src/
├── interpreter/
│   ├── Interpreter.cpp        - Core interpreter (significantly reduced)
│   ├── ExpressionVisitor.cpp  - Expression evaluation
│   ├── StatementVisitor.cpp   - Statement execution
│   ├── TemporalVisitor.cpp    - Temporal operations
│   ├── ResourceManager.cpp    - Resource management
│   └── EnvironmentManager.cpp - Environment management
├── include/
│   ├── interpreter/
│   │   ├── Interpreter.h
│   │   ├── ExpressionVisitor.h
│   │   ├── StatementVisitor.h
│   │   ├── TemporalVisitor.h
│   │   ├── ResourceManager.h
│   │   └── EnvironmentManager.h
```

## Migration Strategy

1. First, implement the new components without changing existing code
2. Add tests for the new components
3. Gradually migrate functionality from the old implementation to the new components
4. Run tests at each step to ensure behavior is preserved
5. Once all functionality is migrated, remove the old implementation

## Success Criteria

The refactoring will be considered successful when:

1. All visitor implementations are extracted into separate files
2. Resource handling is centralized in dedicated components
3. Unit tests exist for all components
4. The interpreter passes all existing integration tests
5. The code is more maintainable and easier to extend
