# Core Utilities: The Foundation of Temporal Operations



## Introduction

The 4ever Standard Library provides a comprehensive set of core utilities that form the foundation of temporal operations. These utilities enable developers to perform common tasks efficiently while maintaining timeline stability and resource management.



## Core Operations



### 1. Timeline Management

```4ever

// Timeline creation and manipulation

timeline_ops {

    create: {

        stability: high;

        resources: {

            aethel: 10;

            chronon: 5;

        }

    }

    merge: {

        stability: medium;

        resources: {

            aethel: 5;

            chronon: 3;

        }

    }

    split: {

        stability: low;

        resources: {

            aethel: 8;

            chronon: 4;

        }

    }

}



// Timeline utilities

timeline_utils {

    stabilize: {

        method: automatic;

        priority: high;

    }

    validate: {

        checks: [stability, consistency, causality];

        threshold: 0.8;

    }

    optimize: {

        strategy: balanced;

        focus: [resources, stability, performance];

    }

}

```



### 2. Resource Operations

```4ever

// Resource management utilities

resource_ops {

    allocate: {

        aethel: {

            amount: 100;

            priority: high;

        }

        chronon: {

            amount: 50;

            priority: medium;

        }

    }

    deallocate: {

        method: graceful;

        cleanup: true;

    }

    optimize: {

        strategy: efficient;

        target: [aethel, chronon];

    }

}



// Resource monitoring

resource_utils {

    track: {

        metrics: [usage, efficiency, waste];

        interval: real_time;

    }

    predict: {

        horizon: 10;

        accuracy: high;

    }

    alert: {

        thresholds: {

            critical: 0.1;

            warning: 0.3;

        }

    }

}

```



### 3. State Management

```4ever

// State operations

state_ops {

    save: {

        method: atomic;

        consistency: guaranteed;

    }

    restore: {

        method: safe;

        validation: true;

    }

    sync: {

        method: automatic;

        conflict_resolution: smart;

    }

}



// State utilities

state_utils {

    validate: {

        checks: [consistency, integrity, causality];

        strictness: high;

    }

    optimize: {

        strategy: balanced;

        focus: [memory, performance, stability];

    }

    monitor: {

        metrics: [changes, conflicts, stability];

        interval: continuous;

    }

}

```

    }

}



// Merge timelines

timeline_ops.merge {

    stability: medium;

    validation: true;

}

```



### Resource Management

// Allocate resources

resource_ops.allocate {

    aethel: {

        amount: 100;

        priority: high;

    }

    chronon: {

        amount: 50;

        priority: medium;

    }

}

    interval: real_time;

}

```
