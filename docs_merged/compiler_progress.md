# Chronicle Compiler Implementation Progress

## 1. Overview

This document tracks the progress of the Chronicle Compiler implementation for the Chronovyan programming language. It provides a summary of completed work, current status, and next steps.

## 2. Completed Components

### 2.1 Lexical Analysis

- **Token System**: Implemented a robust token representation with source location tracking and value storage.
  - TokenType enumeration for all Chronovyan tokens
  - Token class with support for various value types
  - SourceLocation struct for precise error reporting

- **Diagnostic System**: Created a comprehensive error reporting system.
  - DiagnosticSeverity enumeration (ERROR, WARNING, INFO, HINT)
  - DiagnosticMessage class for structured error messages
  - DiagnosticReporter class for collecting and reporting diagnostics

- **Lexer Implementation**: Developed a complete lexer for Chronovyan.
  - Support for all token types defined in the language spec
  - Handling of complex tokens like resource literals (10C, 5A)
  - Comprehensive error reporting for lexical errors
  - Support for comments (line and block)
  - Character and string literal handling with escape sequences

- **Test Suite**: Created a test program for the lexer.
  - Tests for basic tokens, operators, keywords
  - Tests for literals, identifiers, and comments
  - Tests for a complete Chronovyan program
  - Tests for error handling and recovery

- **Build System**: Set up a CMake-based build system.
  - Compiler library (chronicle_compiler)
  - Test executable (lexer_test)
  - Proper directory structure and include paths
  - Platform-independent configuration

## 3. Current Status

The lexical analysis phase of the compiler is complete and ready for integration with the parser. The lexer can:

- Tokenize any valid Chronovyan program
- Provide detailed error messages for lexical errors
- Handle all token types defined in the language specification
- Track source locations for precise error reporting

## 4. Next Steps

### 4.1 Syntax Analysis

- Implement the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node classes
- Develop the recursive descent parser
- Implement error recovery strategies
- Create test suite for the parser

### 4.2 Semantic Analysis

- Implement symbol table for variable resolution
- Add type checking and inference
- Implement CONF/REB classification validation
- Add resource usage analysis

### 4.3 Intermediate Representation

- Design and implement the ChronIR
- Create conversion from AST to IR
- Implement IR validation and visualization

## 5. Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Lexical Analysis (Complete)
- **Phase 2**: Syntax Analysis (Next)
- **Phase 3**: Semantic Analysis
- **Phase 4**: IR Design and Implementation
- **Phase 5**: Optimization Passes
- **Phase 6**: Code Generation
- **Phase 7**: Runtime Integration

## 6. Challenges and Solutions

### 6.1 Lexical Analysis Challenges

- **Resource Literals**: Implemented special handling for resource literals (10C, 5A)
- **Escape Sequences**: Added support for escape sequences in string literals
- **Error Reporting**: Created a comprehensive diagnostic system for detailed error messages
- **Source Location Tracking**: Implemented precise source location tracking for better debugging

## 7. Conclusion

The Chronicle Compiler implementation is progressing according to plan. The lexical analysis phase is complete, providing a solid foundation for the subsequent phases. The next focus will be on the syntax analysis phase, which will transform the token stream into an abstract syntax tree.
