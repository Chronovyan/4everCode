# Act I, Chapter 1: First Echoes in Chronovya

## The Wayfinder Monoliths Challenge

### Narrative Context

*You've arrived in Chronovya, a strange alien world with unfamiliar technology and surroundings. After recovering from your rough transit through the portal, you notice three unusual structures in the distance—tall monoliths that seem to pulse with a faint energy. CORA informs you that these appear to be "Wayfinder Monoliths" mentioned in Professor Thorne's notes, devices that can generate a local area map if activated properly.*

*"These monoliths might help us establish a safe zone," CORA suggests, hovering beside you. "According to the professor's data fragments, they respond to specific communication patterns. We'll need to use some basic 4ever programming to activate them."*

### Learning Objectives

- Understand variable declaration and usage in 4ever
- Work with different data types (numbers, strings, booleans)
- Store and manipulate values
- Display output using print statements
- Call simple methods on objects
- Read data from sensor-like objects

### Challenge Description

**Mapping the Safe Zone**

To activate the Wayfinder Monoliths, you need to write a program that gathers specific environmental data, formats it correctly, and transmits it to each monolith. Once all three are activated, they will triangulate your position and generate a map of the surrounding area.

```
CORA's Analysis:
-----------------------------
WAYFINDER MONOLITH SYSTEM
-----------------------------
Purpose: Area mapping and safe zone identification
Requirements: Three monoliths must be activated
Activation method: Each monolith requires specific environmental data

Monolith 1: Requires atmospheric pressure data
Monolith 2: Requires ambient temperature data
Monolith 3: Requires radiation level data

All data must be properly formatted and transmitted to activate the system.
```

### Initial Code

```
// Wayfinder Monolith Activation Program
// We need to gather data and activate all three monoliths

// Declaration of variables to store environmental readings
DECLARE CONF atmospheric_pressure : FLOAT;  // in hPa
DECLARE CONF ambient_temperature : FLOAT;   // in °C
DECLARE CONF radiation_level : INT;         // in μSv

// Status tracking
DECLARE CONF monoliths_activated : INT = 0;
DECLARE CONF mapping_complete : BOOL = false;

// Your code needs to:
// 1. Take readings from CORA's sensors
// 2. Store the values in the appropriate variables
// 3. Format and transmit the data to each monolith
// 4. Track successful activations
```

### The Challenge

Write a program that:
1. Reads environmental data from CORA's sensors
2. Stores the readings in appropriate variables
3. Formats the data as required for each monolith
4. Transmits the formatted data to each monolith
5. Tracks which monoliths have been activated
6. Confirms when all monoliths are active and mapping is complete

### Example Solution

```
// Wayfinder Monolith Activation Program

// Declaration of variables to store environmental readings
DECLARE CONF atmospheric_pressure : FLOAT;  // in hPa
DECLARE CONF ambient_temperature : FLOAT;   // in °C
DECLARE CONF radiation_level : INT;         // in μSv

// Status tracking
DECLARE CONF monoliths_activated : INT = 0;
DECLARE CONF mapping_complete : BOOL = false;

// Read data from CORA's sensors
atmospheric_pressure = cora.sensor.readAtmosphericPressure();
ambient_temperature = cora.sensor.readAmbientTemperature();
radiation_level = cora.sensor.readRadiationLevel();

// Display the readings
print("Environmental readings:");
print("- Atmospheric pressure: " + atmospheric_pressure + " hPa");
print("- Ambient temperature: " + ambient_temperature + " °C");
print("- Radiation level: " + radiation_level + " μSv");

// Activate Monolith 1 with atmospheric pressure data
DECLARE CONF monolith1_message : STRING = "ACTIVATE:PRESSURE:" + atmospheric_pressure;
wayfinder_monolith1.transmit(monolith1_message);
print("Transmitted to Monolith 1: " + monolith1_message);
monoliths_activated = monoliths_activated + 1;

// Activate Monolith 2 with temperature data
DECLARE CONF monolith2_message : STRING = "ACTIVATE:TEMPERATURE:" + ambient_temperature;
wayfinder_monolith2.transmit(monolith2_message);
print("Transmitted to Monolith 2: " + monolith2_message);
monoliths_activated = monoliths_activated + 1;

// Activate Monolith 3 with radiation data
DECLARE CONF monolith3_message : STRING = "ACTIVATE:RADIATION:" + radiation_level;
wayfinder_monolith3.transmit(monolith3_message);
print("Transmitted to Monolith 3: " + monolith3_message);
monoliths_activated = monoliths_activated + 1;

// Check if all monoliths are activated
IF (monoliths_activated == 3) {
    mapping_complete = true;
    print("All Wayfinder Monoliths activated!");
    print("Safe zone mapping in progress...");
} ELSE {
    print("Warning: Not all monoliths activated. Count: " + monoliths_activated);
}
```

### Test Cases

The game will test your code with varying environmental conditions:
1. Standard conditions (pressure: 1013.2 hPa, temperature: 22.5°C, radiation: 15 μSv)
2. Extreme conditions (pressure: 890.7 hPa, temperature: 35.8°C, radiation: 42 μSv)
3. Low energy conditions (pressure: 1005.3 hPa, temperature: 10.2°C, radiation: 8 μSv)

### Game Feedback

```
WAYFINDER MONOLITH SYSTEM
-----------------------------
Monolith 1: ACTIVATED
Monolith 2: ACTIVATED
Monolith 3: ACTIVATED
All systems operational

The three monoliths begin to hum in unison, each emitting a beam of light
upward into the sky. Where the beams intersect, a holographic display forms,
showing a detailed map of your surrounding area.

CORA: "Excellent work! The map reveals a safe zone extending approximately
500 meters in all directions from our current position. It also shows several
points of interest nearby, including what appears to be a crystal field to
the east and some sort of structure beyond that."

### Extended Challenge: Data Validation

After the basic activation, an extended challenge appears:

```
CORA's ANALYSIS:
Further examination of Professor Thorne's notes indicates the Wayfinder system
has a data validation feature. Each reading must be verified to be within
expected ranges before transmission to ensure mapping accuracy.

Add validation checks to your code:
- Atmospheric pressure should be between 900-1100 hPa
- Temperature should be between -10 and 40°C
- Radiation levels should be below 50 μSv

Any values outside these ranges should be marked as potentially erroneous.
```

### Extended Solution

// Status tracking
DECLARE CONF monoliths_activated : INT = 0;
DECLARE CONF mapping_complete : BOOL = false;

// Data validation flags
DECLARE CONF valid_pressure : BOOL = false;
DECLARE CONF valid_temperature : BOOL = false;
DECLARE CONF valid_radiation : BOOL = false;

// Read data from CORA's sensors
atmospheric_pressure = cora.sensor.readAtmosphericPressure();
ambient_temperature = cora.sensor.readAmbientTemperature();
radiation_level = cora.sensor.readRadiationLevel();

// Display the readings
print("Environmental readings:");
print("- Atmospheric pressure: " + atmospheric_pressure + " hPa");
print("- Ambient temperature: " + ambient_temperature + " °C");

    print("Area may be unsafe! Proceeding with caution...");
    valid_radiation = true;  // We still proceed but with a warning
}

// Proceed with monolith activation if all data is valid
IF (valid_pressure && valid_temperature && valid_radiation) {
    // Activate Monolith 1 with atmospheric pressure data
    DECLARE CONF monolith1_message : STRING = "ACTIVATE:PRESSURE:" + atmospheric_pressure;
    wayfinder_monolith1.transmit(monolith1_message);
    print("Transmitted to Monolith 1: " + monolith1_message);
    monoliths_activated = monoliths_activated + 1;
    
    // Activate Monolith 2 with temperature data

            print("NOTE: Elevated radiation levels detected. Safe zone may require monitoring.");
        }
    }
} ELSE {
    print("ERROR: Data validation failed. Cannot activate monoliths with invalid readings.");
}
```

### Game Response to Extended Challenge

```
WAYFINDER MONOLITH SYSTEM
-----------------------------
Monolith 1: ACTIVATED
Monolith 2: ACTIVATED
Monolith 3: ACTIVATED
All systems operational
Data validation: COMPLETE

The holographic map generated by the monoliths appears more detailed and
precise than before. It now shows subtle variations in environmental
conditions across the mapped area, with color-coded zones indicating
optimal camping locations, potential resource sites, and areas to avoid.

CORA: "Remarkable improvement! The data validation has increased mapping
accuracy by 42%. We now have a much clearer picture of our surroundings
and the relative safety of different areas. This will be invaluable for
establishing a sustainable base of operations."

### Next Challenge Preview

```
CORA'S ANALYSIS:
With our safe zone established, we should explore the crystal field
to the east. My sensors detect unusual energy patterns there. However,
some crystals appear to emit potentially harmful radiation. We'll need
to develop a system to distinguish between safe and dangerous crystals
using conditional logic...
