# Core Documentation

Welcome to the core documentation of Chronovyan. This section contains the fundamental concepts, syntax, and principles that form the foundation of the Chronovyan programming language and its API.

## Getting Started

- [Manifesto](Manifesto.md) - The philosophical foundation of Chronovyan
- [Core Concepts](Core%20Concepts%20-%20The%20Foundation%20of%20Temporal%20Programming.md) - Fundamental concepts of temporal programming
- [Core Syntax & Constructs](Core%20Syntax%20&%20Constructs.md) - Language syntax and core constructs
- [Getting Started Guide](../getting-started/first-program.md) - Your first Chronovyan program

## Key Components

### Variable System
- [Variable System Overview](Variable%20System%20-%20The%20Duality%20of%20Data.md) - Understanding variables in Chronovyan
- [Variable Types](../api/variable_system/variable_types.md) - Different types of variables and their usage
- [Variable Flags](../api/variable_system/variable_flags.md) - Metadata and behavior control for variables

### Resource Management
- [Resource Management](Resource%20Management%20-%20The%20Battle%20for%20Temporal%20Control.md) - Managing temporal resources
- [Resource Tracker](../api/resource_management/resource_tracker.md) - Monitor and track resource usage
- [Timeline Trader](../api/resource_management/timeline_trader.md) - Trade resources between timelines

### Timeline System
- [The Great Duality](The%20Great%20Duality%20-%20Order%20and%20Flux.md) - Understanding order and flux in Chronovyan
- [Timeline Manager](../api/timeline/timeline_manager.md) - Manage and coordinate multiple timelines
- [Quantum Manager](../api/quantum/quantum_manager.md) - Handle quantum temporal operations

## Advanced Topics

- [Programming as Temporal Weaving](Programming%20as%20Temporal%20Weaving.md) - Advanced programming concepts
- [Coding Philosophies](Coding%20Philosophies%20-%20The%20Art%20of%20Temporal%20Expression.md) - Best practices and patterns
- [Practical Applications](Practical%20Applications%20-%20The%20Living%20Narrative%20of%20Code.md) - Real-world use cases
- [Performance Optimization](../guides/performance.md) - Best practices for optimal performance
