## Next Steps for Development

1. **Create Missing Examples:**
   - Develop the examples marked as "to be created"
   - Ensure all examples follow consistent coding style and difficulty progression

2. **Refine Quest Integration:**
   - Develop detailed narratives for each side quest
   - Create specific puzzle mechanics that teach the intended concepts
   - Design reward dialogues and CORA interactions

3. **Example Formatting:**
   - Standardize all examples to match our learning loop format
   - Add narrative framing and attribution to each example
   - Ensure examples are properly commented for educational value

4. **CORA Dialogue Development:**
   - Create CORA's contextual hints for each example
   - Develop dialogue that suggests connections between examples and main quests
   - Design CORA's analysis responses for each code example
