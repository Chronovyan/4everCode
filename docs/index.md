## üöÄ Why Chronovyan?

Chronovyan is designed from the ground up for temporal programming, making it easy to work with time-dependent computations, event scheduling, and time-series data processing.

### Key Features

- **Temporal Types**: First-class support for time-based data types and operations
- **Concurrent by Design**: Built-in primitives for safe concurrency and parallelism
- **Deterministic Execution**: Predictable behavior for time-dependent operations
- **Resource Management**: Efficient handling of temporal resources
- **Type Safety**: Strong, static type system with type inference
- **Intuitive API**: Designed to be easy to use and understand
- **Flexible**: Suitable for a wide range of applications

## üèÅ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Prerequisites:
# - C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 11+, Clang 12+, or MSVC 2019 16.11+)
# - CMake 3.20 or higher
# - Python 3.8+ (for build scripts)
# - Git

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Chronovyan/Chronovyan.git
cd Chronovyan

# Install build dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Configure and build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release

# Run tests
ctest -C Release --output-on-failure
```

### 2. Your First Chronovyan Program

Create a file named `hello.chrono`:

```rust
// A simple Chronovyan program
fn main() {
    // Print a greeting
    println!("Hello, Chronovyan!");
    
    // Demonstrate a simple temporal operation
    let now = time::now();
    println!("Current time: {}", now);
    
    // Schedule a future event
    let future = now + Duration::seconds(5);
    println!("Will print again at: {}", future);
    
    // Wait for the future time
    time::sleep_until(future);
    println!("Five seconds later...");
}
```

Run the program:

```bash
./build/bin/chrono run hello.chrono
```

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Game Development**: Manage game loops, animations, and timed events
- **Simulations**: Model complex temporal systems
- **Data Processing**: Schedule and coordinate data pipelines
- **Interactive Applications**: Create responsive UIs with timed interactions
- **Financial Systems**: Process time-series data and events
- **IoT Applications**: Handle device synchronization and scheduling
