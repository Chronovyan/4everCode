# Core Concepts

Welcome to the core concepts of **Forever Code**, a revolutionary approach to building immutable, persistent, and perpetual digital entities. This section covers the fundamental principles that make Forever Code unique and powerful.

## Core Principles

Forever Code is built on three fundamental principles that define its approach to data and computation:

1. **Immutability**
   - Data is never modified in place
   - Every change creates a new version
   - Complete history is preserved
   - Enables time-travel debugging
   - Simplifies concurrency

2. **Persistence**
   - Data outlives the process
   - Built-in persistence layer
   - Automatic versioning
   - Efficient storage strategies
   - Seamless loading/saving

3. **Perpetuity**
   - Data is designed to last forever
   - Forward-compatible formats
   - Self-describing data
   - Migration tools
   - Long-term storage strategies

## Core Abstractions

### Entity {#entity}
- Fundamental unit of data
- Strongly typed
- Immutable by default
- Versioned
- Self-contained

### Repository {#repository}
- Manages entity lifecycle
- Handles persistence
- Provides query interface
- Manages transactions
- Handles concurrency

### Event {#event}
- Represents state changes
- Immutable and append-only
- Ordered sequence
- Supports event sourcing
- Enables time-travel debugging

## Data Management

Forever Code provides several data management strategies:

1. **In-Memory**
   - Fast access
   - Limited by RAM
   - Great for caching

2. **Local Storage**
   - Persistent on disk
   - Transactional
   - ACID compliant

3. **Distributed Storage**
   - Horizontally scalable
   - Highly available
   - Eventually consistent

## Performance Considerations

When working with Forever Code, keep these performance considerations in mind:

1. **Data Access Patterns**
   - Optimize for read/write patterns
   - Use appropriate indexes
   - Leverage caching

2. **Storage Optimization**
   - Choose right storage backend
   - Optimize data structures
   - Monitor storage growth

3. **Query Optimization**
   - Use appropriate indexes
   - Optimize query patterns
   - Leverage materialized views

## Concurrency Model

Forever Code's concurrency model is designed to handle distributed operations safely and efficiently:

- **Isolated Transactions**: ACID-compliant operations
- **Optimistic Concurrency Control**: For high throughput
- **Eventual Consistency**: For distributed systems
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic conflict resolution strategies
- **Worker Pools**: For CPU-bound operations
- **Channels**: Thread-safe communication
- **Synchronization Primitives**: Locks, barriers, and conditions
