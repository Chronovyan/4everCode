# Chronovyan API Reference

Welcome to the Chronovyan API Reference. This documentation provides detailed information about the various components and their APIs in the Chronovyan ecosystem.

## Core Components

### Resource Management
- [Timeline Trader](./resource_management/timeline_trader.md) - Handles trading and arbitration of temporal resources
- [Resource Tracker](./resource_management/resource_tracker.md) - Monitors and tracks resource usage

### Variable System
- [Variable Types](./variable_system/variable_types.md) - Different types of variables and their usage
- [Variable Flags](./variable_system/variable_flags.md) - Metadata and behavior control for variables

### Timeline
- [Timeline Manager](./timeline/timeline_manager.md) - Manages and coordinates multiple timelines

### Quantum
- [Quantum Manager](./quantum/quantum_manager.md) - Handles quantum temporal operations and parallel timelines

## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

```cpp
#include <chronovyan/chronovyan.hpp>

int main() {
    // Initialize the timeline manager
    auto& timeline_mgr = TimelineManager::instance();
    
    // Create a new timeline
    auto timeline = timeline_mgr.create_timeline("my_timeline");
    
    // Add events to the timeline
    timeline_mgr.add_event(timeline, []() {
        std::cout << "Hello from the timeline!" << std::endl;
    });
    
    // Start the timeline
    timeline_mgr.start(timeline);
    
    // Wait for completion
    timeline_mgr.join(timeline);
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Advanced Topics

### Resource Management
Learn how to efficiently manage temporal resources across different timelines.

### Variable System
Understand the type system and how to work with different variable types.

### Quantum Temporal Operations
Explore advanced quantum-inspired temporal operations and parallel timeline processing.

## Best Practices

1. **Resource Cleanup**
   Always ensure proper cleanup of resources to prevent leaks.

2. **Error Handling**
   Implement comprehensive error handling for robust applications.

3. **Performance Considerations**
   Be mindful of performance implications when working with multiple timelines.

4. **Thread Safety**
   Understand the thread safety guarantees of different components.
