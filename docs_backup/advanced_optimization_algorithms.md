# Advanced Optimization Algorithms

## Overview

The Advanced Optimization Algorithms module extends the basic resource optimization capabilities of Chronovyan with sophisticated strategies for automatic efficiency improvements. This system uses machine learning techniques, pattern recognition, predictive modeling, and evolutionary algorithms to optimize resource allocation and usage across operations.

## Key Features

### Pattern Recognition

The system can detect various patterns in resource usage:

- **Repetitive Patterns**: Consistent resource usage with minimal variation
- **Increasing/Decreasing Patterns**: Gradually changing resource usage over time
- **Cyclic Patterns**: Periodic fluctuations in resource usage
- **Spike Patterns**: Occasional large increases in resource usage
- **Random Patterns**: No discernible pattern in resource usage

### Optimization Strategies

Multiple optimization strategies are available to suit different requirements:

- **Conservative**: Prioritizes stability over efficiency, making minimal changes
- **Balanced**: Balances efficiency and stability for general-purpose optimization
- **Aggressive**: Prioritizes efficiency over stability, making significant changes
- **Adaptive**: Dynamically adjusts based on the current system state
- **Predictive**: Uses predictive modeling to optimize based on future needs
- **Experimental**: Uses cutting-edge techniques that may be less stable

### Optimization Techniques

The module implements several advanced optimization techniques:

- **Predictive Optimization**: Uses pattern recognition to predict future resource needs
- **Neural Network Optimization**: Employs neural networks to learn and optimize resource allocation
- **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**: Uses evolutionary algorithms to find optimal allocation strategies
- **Comprehensive Optimization**: Combines multiple techniques for maximum efficiency

### Reporting and Visualization

Comprehensive reporting and visualization tools are included:

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```cpp
// Create a runtime and debt tracker
auto runtime = std::make_shared<TemporalRuntime>();
auto debt_tracker = std::make_shared<TemporalDebtTracker>(runtime);

// Create the advanced optimizer with balanced strategy
AdvancedOptimizationAlgorithms optimizer(
    runtime, 
    debt_tracker, 
    OptimizationConfig(),
    OptimizationStrategy::BALANCED);

// Perform basic optimization for an operation
double improvement = optimizer.optimizeOperation("my_operation");
std::cout << "Achieved " << (improvement * 100.0) << "% improvement\n";
```

### Pattern Detection

```cpp
// Detect patterns using different algorithms
auto basic_result = optimizer.detectPatternAdvanced(
    "my_operation", 
    PatternMatchingAlgorithm::BASIC_STATISTICAL);
    
auto fourier_result = optimizer.detectPatternAdvanced(
    "my_operation", 
    PatternMatchingAlgorithm::FOURIER_TRANSFORM);
    
std::cout << "Detected pattern: " << basic_result.primary_pattern << "\n";
std::cout << "Confidence: " << (basic_result.confidence * 100.0) << "%\n";

if (basic_result.is_seasonal) {
    std::cout << "Seasonal pattern with period: " << basic_result.seasonality_period << "\n";
}
```

### Advanced Optimization Techniques

```cpp
// Predictive optimization
double pred_improvement = optimizer.optimizePredictive("my_operation", 5);

// Neural network optimization
double nn_improvement = optimizer.optimizeNeuralNetwork("my_operation");

// Genetic algorithm optimization
double genetic_improvement = optimizer.optimizeGenetic(50, 10);

// Comprehensive optimization (uses all available techniques)
double comp_improvement = optimizer.optimizeComprehensive("my_operation");

std::cout << "Predictive: " << (pred_improvement * 100.0) << "%\n";
std::cout << "Neural Network: " << (nn_improvement * 100.0) << "%\n";
std::cout << "Genetic: " << (genetic_improvement * 100.0) << "%\n";
std::cout << "Comprehensive: " << (comp_improvement * 100.0) << "%\n";
```

### Optimization Profiles

```cpp
// Load a predefined profile
optimizer.loadOptimizationProfile("aggressive");

// Create a custom profile
OptimizationProfile custom_profile("custom", OptimizationStrategy::ADAPTIVE);
custom_profile.risk_tolerance = 0.7;
custom_profile.efficiency_target = 0.85;
custom_profile.algorithm_weights["predictive"] = 0.5;
custom_profile.algorithm_weights["neural"] = 0.3;
custom_profile.algorithm_weights["genetic"] = 0.2;

optimizer.createOptimizationProfile(custom_profile);

// Get available profiles
auto profiles = optimizer.getAvailableProfiles();
for (const auto& [name, profile] : profiles) {
    std::cout << "Profile: " << name << "\n";
}
```

### Comparing Strategies

```cpp
// Compare different optimization strategies
std::vector<OptimizationStrategy> strategies = {
    OptimizationStrategy::CONSERVATIVE,
    OptimizationStrategy::BALANCED,
    OptimizationStrategy::AGGRESSIVE,
    OptimizationStrategy::ADAPTIVE
};

auto comparison = optimizer.compareOptimizationStrategies("my_operation", strategies);

for (const auto& [strategy, improvement] : comparison) {
    std::cout << "Strategy " << static_cast<int>(strategy) 
              << ": " << (improvement * 100.0) << "% improvement\n";
}
```

### Reporting and Visualization

```cpp
// Generate efficiency report
std::string report = optimizer.generateEfficiencyReport(true);
std::cout << report << "\n";

// Visualize optimization opportunities
std::string text_viz = optimizer.visualizeOptimizationOpportunities(
    VisualizationFormat::TEXT);
std::cout << text_viz << "\n";

std::string html_viz = optimizer.visualizeOptimizationOpportunities(
    VisualizationFormat::HTML);
// Save HTML visualization to file or display in browser

std::string json_viz = optimizer.visualizeOptimizationOpportunities(
    VisualizationFormat::JSON);
// Parse JSON visualization for further processing
```

## Pattern Detection Algorithms

3. Implement your custom algorithm
4. Register your algorithm with appropriate weights in the profiles

Example:

```cpp
class CustomOptimizationAlgorithms : public AdvancedOptimizationAlgorithms {
public:
    CustomOptimizationAlgorithms(
        std::shared_ptr<TemporalRuntime> runtime, 
        std::shared_ptr<TemporalDebtTracker> debt_tracker = nullptr,
        const OptimizationConfig& config = OptimizationConfig())
        : AdvancedOptimizationAlgorithms(runtime, debt_tracker, config) {
        
        // Register custom algorithm in profiles
        for (auto& [name, profile] : m_profiles) {
            profile.algorithm_weights["custom"] = 0.2;
        }
    }
    
    double optimizeCustom(const std::string& operation_id) {
        // Custom optimization logic
        return improvement_factor;
    }
    
    double optimizeComprehensive(const std::string& operation_id) override {
        // Include custom algorithm in comprehensive optimization
        std::vector<double> results = {
            AdvancedOptimizationAlgorithms::optimizeComprehensive(operation_id),
            optimizeCustom(operation_id)
        };
        
        return *std::max_element(results.begin(), results.end());
    }
};
