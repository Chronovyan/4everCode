# Act I, Chapter 1: First Echoes in Chronovya

## Arrival in Chronovya

The portal's collapse throws Alex against hard ground, knocking the wind from his lungs. The chaotic, nauseating sensation of the transit fades, replaced by the sharp sting of unfamiliar air and a cacophony of alien sounds. Alex gasps, vision swimming, as a strange sky comes into focus – a swirling tapestry of deep purples and blues, punctuated by two pale moons hanging impossibly large on the horizon. The air tastes metallic, tinged with something like ozone and sweet, unfamiliar botanicals.

"CORA!" Alex scrambles to his knees, scanning the surroundings. They've landed in a small clearing amidst towering crystalline structures – not quite trees, not quite rock formations – that pulse with subtle, internal light. The drone lies nearby, its housing cracked further by the impact, but its optical sensor flickers with stronger blue light than before. CORA's voice comes through clearer, though still strained: "Systems... recalibrating. Location: unknown. Environment scan: atmosphere breathable but with elevated trace elements. Warning: Energy reserves critical. Require... power source."

Alex helps CORA into a more stable position, surveying their landing site with growing apprehension. The physics here seem... different. Shadows fall at odd angles, and occasional motes of light drift upward against gravity. In the near distance, through a gap in the crystal formations, stands what appears to be a structure – possibly ruins, possibly shelter. More immediately concerning, however, is a peculiar stone at the edge of the clearing – roughly spherical, about the size of a basketball, with intricate patterns etched across its surface. Unlike the ambient glow of the surrounding crystals, this stone pulses with rhythmic light, almost like breathing. As Alex approaches it cautiously, CORA's sensor brightens with sudden interest.

"Alex," CORA says, voice stronger now. "That object... preliminary scan suggests it's a Chronovyan artifact. Possibly... yes, it matches fragmented records from Professor Thorne's database. I believe it's what Thorne called a 'Whispering Stone' – a basic atmospheric sensor. If we can interface with it correctly, it might provide crucial environmental data."
