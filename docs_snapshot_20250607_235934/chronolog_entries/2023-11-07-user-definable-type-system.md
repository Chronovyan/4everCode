# 2023-11-07: Implementation of the User-Definable TYPE System

## Overview

Today marks a significant milestone in the Chronovyan project with the implementation of the user-definable TYPE system. This feature allows users to define custom data types with built-in temporal semantics, enabling more expressive and domain-specific modeling of time-varying systems.

## Key Components

The implementation consists of several key components:

1. **UserTypeSystem Class**: A central manager for user-defined types, handling type registration, validation, and instance creation.

2. **TypeBuilder Pattern**: A fluent interface for defining different kinds of types (structs, enums, unions, aliases) with their properties.

3. **Native Functions**: A set of Chronovyan language functions that expose the type system functionality to scripts.

4. **Temporal Instance Tracking**: Support for tracking the history of type instances across cycles.

5. **Resource Tracking**: Integration with the chronon system to track resource usage for type operations.

## Technical Details

### Type Kinds

The system supports four kinds of user-defined types:

- **Structs**: Composite types with named fields, each with its own type and properties (required/optional, default values)
- **Enums**: Types with a predefined set of named values
- **Unions**: Types that can represent values of different types
- **Aliases**: Alternative names for existing types

### Temporal Support

Types can be declared as "temporal," which means that changes to their instances are automatically tracked across cycles. This enables:

- Retrieving the complete history of an instance
- Accessing the state of an instance at a specific cycle
- Analyzing how instances change over time

### Integration with Existing Systems

The user type system integrates with several existing Chronovyan systems:

- **TemporalRuntime**: For cycle tracking and resource management
- **Interpreter**: For exposing native functions to the scripting language
- **ErrorHandler**: For reporting errors during type definition and usage
- **CustomTypeSystem**: The user type system complements the existing type system

## Implementation Challenges

Several challenges were addressed during implementation:

1. **Memory Management**: Ensuring proper lifetime management for type definitions and instances
2. **Validation**: Comprehensive validation of type definitions and instance operations
3. **Temporal Semantics**: Designing a clean interface for temporal tracking while maintaining performance
4. **Resource Tracking**: Balancing accurate resource tracking with performance
5. **API Design**: Creating an intuitive and consistent API for type definition and usage

## Example Usage

The user-definable TYPE system enables powerful modeling capabilities:

```
// Define a temporal Vehicle struct
DEFINE_STRUCT("Vehicle", {
    "model": "string",
    "year": "int",
    "mileage": "int"
}, true);  // Enable temporal tracking

// Create an instance
var car = CREATE_INSTANCE("Vehicle", {
    "model": "Tesla Model 3",
    "year": 2023,
    "mileage": 0
});

// Modify at different cycles
ADVANCE_CYCLE();
SET_INSTANCE_FIELD(car, "mileage", 1000);

ADVANCE_CYCLE();
SET_INSTANCE_FIELD(car, "mileage", 5000);

// Get history and analyze
var history = GET_INSTANCE_HISTORY(car);
var carAtCycle1 = GET_INSTANCE_AT_CYCLE(car, 1);
```

## Applications

The user-definable TYPE system enables a wide range of applications:

- **Game Development**: Track game entities and their state over time
- **Simulation**: Model complex systems with changing state
- **Business Applications**: Track business entities and processes
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze how data changes over time
- **IoT and Sensors**: Model sensor data with temporal semantics

## Documentation and Examples

To showcase the capabilities of the user-definable TYPE system, we've created:

- **user_type_system.md**: Comprehensive documentation of the system
- **type_system_demo.cpp**: A simple demonstration of the basic features
- **temporal_inventory_system.cpp**: A more complex example showing a practical application

## Future Directions

While the current implementation provides a solid foundation, there are several directions for future enhancement:

1. **Methods**: Adding support for defining methods on types
2. **Inheritance**: Enabling type inheritance for more complex modeling
3. **Serialization**: Better support for serializing and deserializing type instances
4. **Query Language**: A more expressive way to query temporal instances
5. **Optimizations**: Performance improvements for large-scale type systems

## Conclusion

The user-definable TYPE system represents a significant step forward in Chronovyan's capabilities, enabling more expressive and domain-specific modeling with built-in temporal semantics. This feature lays the groundwork for more advanced temporal programming patterns and applications.
