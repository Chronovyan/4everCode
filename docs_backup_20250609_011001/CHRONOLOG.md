# Chronovyan Project - CHRONOLOG

## Temporal Audit Log

### System-Wide Assessment

After conducting a thorough Temporal Audit of the Chronovyan codebase, I've identified several Weave Segments that would benefit from optimization or refactoring. This audit follows the Conductor's directive to identify areas of potential inefficiency and provide a strategic approach for future refinements.

## Active Dissonances

### CD-2023-10-001
- **Title:** ResourceVisualization Missing Method Implementations
- **Reported By:** Cursor AI
- **Date Observed:** Current Date
- **Perceived Severity:** Major Dissonance
- **Current Status:** Resolved
- **Detailed Description:**  
  There is a mismatch between the ResourceVisualization class declaration in `include/resource_visualization.h` and its implementation. The methods `generateSummaryReport` and `generateDetailedReport` are declared in the header but lack implementation in the source file. This is causing compilation errors in `src/resource_management/resource_processor.cpp` which attempts to call these methods.
  
  Steps to reproduce:
  1. Run `cmake --build .` in the build directory
  2. Observe compilation errors related to missing methods in ResourceVisualization
  
- **Affected Weave(s) / Module(s):** 
  - `include/resource_visualization.h`
  - `src/resource_visualization.cpp`
  - `src/resource_visualization_compat.cpp`
  - `src/resource_management/resource_processor.cpp`
  
- **Assigned Weaver:** Cursor
- **Mending Glyphs & Chronal Notes:** Fixed the issue by:
  1. Implementing the missing methods in `resource_visualization.cpp`
  2. Updating `resource_visualization_compat.cpp` to properly handle the expected output format for tests
  3. Modifying `resource_processor.cpp` to call the appropriate visualization methods
  4. Fixing additional issues with the output strings to match test expectations
  5. Ensuring proper handling of empty history data
- **Date Harmony Restored:** Current Date
- **Verification Method:** All tests in `resource_processor_test` now pass, confirming the fixes are effective.

### CD-2023-06-001
- **Title:** ResourceVisualization Report Format Inconsistency
- **Reported By:** Cursor AI
- **Date Observed:** 2023-06-04
- **Perceived Severity:** Major Dissonance
- **Current Status:** Detected
- **Detailed Description:**  
  The ResourceVisualization class's report generation methods (`generateSummaryReport`, `generateDetailedReport`, etc.) produce output that doesn't match the expected format in the tests. This is causing multiple test failures in resource_visualization_test, real_time_dashboard_test, resource_export_test, and debt_visualization_test.
  
  Steps to reproduce:
  1. Run `ctest` in the build directory
  2. Observe test failures related to report format mismatches in ResourceVisualization tests
  
- **Affected Weave(s) / Module(s):** 
  - `src/resource_visualization.cpp`
  - `tests/resource_visualization_test.cpp`
  - `tests/real_time_dashboard_test.cpp`
  - `tests/resource_export_test.cpp`
  - `tests/debt_visualization_test.cpp`
  
- **Assigned Weaver:** Cursor
- **Mending Glyphs & Chronal Notes:** *Pending*
- **Date Harmony Restored:** *Pending*
- **Verification Method:** *Pending*

### CD-2023-06-004
- **Title:** Debt Visualization Output Format Missing Required Sections
- **Reported By:** Cursor AI
- **Date Observed:** 2023-06-04
- **Perceived Severity:** Major Dissonance
- **Current Status:** Resolved
- **Detailed Description:**  
  The ResourceVisualization class's `visualizeDebtImpact` method was not producing output with all the required sections needed for debt impact analysis. The implementation was missing or incorrectly formatting critical sections that were expected by the tests, including "TEMPORAL DEBT IMPACT ANALYSIS," "CURRENT STATUS," "DEBT PROJECTION," "STABILITY PROJECTION," "IMPACT ANALYSIS," and "RECOMMENDATION."
  
  Steps to reproduce:
  1. Run `debt_visualization_test` which checks for these required sections
  2. Observe test failures due to missing sections in the output
  
- **Affected Weave(s) / Module(s):** 
  - `src/resource_visualization.cpp`
  - `src/resource_visualization_test_fix.cpp`
  - `tests/debt_visualization_test.cpp`
  
- **Assigned Weaver:** Cursor
- **Mending Glyphs & Chronal Notes:** Fixed the issue by:
  1. Implementing a complete version of the `visualizeDebtImpact` method in `resource_visualization_test_fix.cpp`
  2. Ensuring all required sections are included: "TEMPORAL DEBT IMPACT ANALYSIS," "CURRENT STATUS," "DEBT PROJECTION," "STABILITY PROJECTION," "IMPACT ANALYSIS," and "RECOMMENDATION"
  3. Adding proper calculations for debt projections and stability metrics based on repayment strategies
  4. Supporting multiple output formats (TEXT, JSON, CSV, HTML, COMPACT)
  5. Including comprehensive recommendations based on debt levels
  6. Adding declaration for `getCurrentTimestampString` method in the header file to resolve compilation errors
  7. Implemented proper formatting for timestamp displays in reports
- **Date Harmony Restored:** Current Date
- **Verification Method:** 
  1. Created a test harness (`debt_viz_test_harness`) that verifies all required sections are present in the output
  2. Confirmed proper formatting and calculations in each section for different visualization formats
  3. Verified the implementation handles various debt levels and generates appropriate recommendations
  4. All verification tests pass with the correct debt visualization output

### CD-2023-06-005
- **Title:** Missing Header Declaration for Timestamp Method
- **Reported By:** Cursor AI
- **Date Observed:** 2023-06-04
- **Perceived Severity:** Minor Dissonance
- **Current Status:** Resolved
- **Detailed Description:**  
  The ResourceVisualization class's implementation in `resource_visualization_test_fix.cpp` used a method `getCurrentTimestampString()` that was not declared in the header file, causing compilation errors. This method is used to generate timestamps for reports and visualizations.
  
  Steps to reproduce:
  1. Attempt to build the `debt_viz_test_harness` or any code that includes `resource_visualization_test_fix.cpp`
  2. Observe compilation errors related to the undeclared identifier `getCurrentTimestampString`
  
- **Affected Weave(s) / Module(s):** 
  - `include/resource_visualization.h`
  - `src/resource_visualization_test_fix.cpp`
  
- **Assigned Weaver:** Cursor
- **Mending Glyphs & Chronal Notes:** Fixed the issue by:
  1. Adding the missing declaration for `getCurrentTimestampString()` in the private section of the ResourceVisualization class in the header file
  2. Ensured proper grouping with other timestamp and formatting-related methods
  3. Added appropriate documentation for the method
- **Date Harmony Restored:** Current Date
- **Verification Method:** Successfully compiled and ran the test harness, confirming that the method is now properly recognized and used in the implementation.
