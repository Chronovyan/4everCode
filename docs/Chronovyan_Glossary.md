# 4ever Glossary of Terms

## Purpose

This glossary standardizes terminology across all 4ever documentation, providing clear definitions for both philosophical concepts and their implementation counterparts. It serves as the authoritative reference for understanding the language of temporal programming.

## Core Philosophical Concepts

### The Great Duality

**Order (Conformity)** - The stabilizing force in 4ever that enables coherence, predictability, and reliable structure. Manifests in the form of `CONF` variables, `::STATIC` flags, and deterministic control structures.

**Flux (Rebellion)** - The dynamic, transformative force that enables evolution, adaptation, and novelty. Manifests in the form of `REB` variables, `::FLUX` flags, and non-deterministic control structures.

### Resource Types

**Chronons** - Fundamental units of temporal currency that enable basic timeline operations. The primary resource consumed by temporal manipulations.

**Aethel** - Mystical energy that enables rebellion against temporal norms. Powers non-linear and quantum operations.

**Temporal Stability** - A measure of a timeline's resistance to paradox and unwanted changes.

**Quantum Coherence** - The degree to which quantum states maintain their superposition without collapse.

### Temporal Concepts

**Timeline** - A sequence of chronological events representing a particular path through time.

**Timeline Branch** - An alternate sequence of events that diverges from a main timeline.

**Paradox** - A logical inconsistency created by contradictory timeline states.

**Temporal Debt** - Resources borrowed from future states to enable present operations, requiring eventual repayment.

**Weaving** - The act of programming in 4ever, particularly manipulating timelines and resources.

## Implementation Terminology

### Core Components

**ResourceTracker** - The class responsible for monitoring and managing temporal resources.

**TemporalDebtTracker** - The class that manages debt accrual, tracking, and repayment.

**ResourceVisualization** - The system that provides visual representations of resource usage.

**TimelineManager** - The component that handles timeline creation, manipulation, and navigation.

### Variable System

**CONF Variable** - A stable, predictable variable resistant to temporal changes.

**REB Variable** - A dynamic, flexible variable that adapts across timelines.

**::STATIC Flag** - Indicates a variable with a fixed value that cannot change.

**::VOLATILE Flag** - Indicates a variable whose value can change unexpectedly.

**::ANCHOR Flag** - Indicates a variable that represents a fixed point in a timeline.

**::WEAVER Flag** - Indicates a variable that can manipulate timelines and create branches.

### Resource Operations

**Consume Resource** - An operation that uses a specified amount of a resource.

**Replenish Resource** - An operation that restores a specified amount of a resource.

**Borrow Resource** - An operation that uses future resources, creating temporal debt.

**Repay Debt** - An operation that satisfies previously accrued temporal debt.

### Timeline Operations

**Branch Timeline** - Creates a new divergent timeline from an existing one.

**Merge Timelines** - Combines two timelines into a single coherent timeline.

**Rewind Chronons** - Moves backward along a timeline to a previous state.

**Collapse Timeline** - Eliminates a timeline branch, potentially preserving selected data.

### Quantum Operations

**Create Superposition** - Establishes a quantum state with multiple potential values.

**Collapse Quantum** - Resolves a quantum state to a single definite value.

**Entangle** - Creates a dependent relationship between two quantum variables.

## People and Roles

**Weaver** - A programmer who works with the 4ever language.

**Anchor Weaver** - A programmer who specializes in Order/Conformist principles.

**Rebel Weaver** - A programmer who specializes in Flux/Rebellious principles.

**Seeker** - A programmer who explores new applications and possibilities in 4ever.

**Archive Keeper** - A custodian of 4ever knowledge and documentation.

**First Weaver** - The legendary originator of the 4ever language.

## File and Document Types

**Core Wisdom Scrolls** - The fundamental documents explaining 4ever concepts.

**The Great Scrolls** - The three consolidated documentation guides (Implementation Guide, API Reference, and AI Assistant Guide).

**The Gateway Scroll** - The README document that serves as an entry point to all documentation.

**The Metadata Chronicle** - The documentation metadata file tracking consolidation status.

## Standardized Abbreviations

**CONF** - Conformist (Order-aligned)

**REB** - Rebellious (Flux-aligned)

**TS** - Temporal Stability

**QC** - Quantum Coherence

**TD** - Temporal Debt

**TM** - Timeline Management

## Usage Examples

For proper usage of terminology in documentation, follow these examples:

1. **Philosophical to Implementation**:
   - "The Great Duality of Order and Flux is implemented through the `ResourceTracker::StabilityMode` enum, with `CONFORMIST` and `REBELLIOUS` options."

2. **Variables**:
   - "A `CONF var` in 4ever maps to a variable with the `ORDER_ALIGNED` property in the implementation."

3. **Resources**:
   - "Chronons, the fundamental temporal currency, are implemented as `ResourceType::CHRONO_ENERGY` in the codebase."

4. **Timeline Operations**:
   - "The temporal concept of rewinding is implemented through the `TimelineManager::rewindTimeline()` method."

## Maintaining Terminology Consistency

When creating new documentation:

1. Always refer to this glossary for standard terms
2. Use the exact capitalization and formatting shown here
3. Maintain the philosophical/implementation connection
4. When introducing new terms, add them to this glossary
