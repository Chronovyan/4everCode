# Act I: Arrival & Basic Survival

## Overview

After being transported to the mysterious world of Chronovya through Professor Thorne's experimental equipment, Alex and CORA must learn to survive and adapt to this alien environment. Act I focuses on the fundamental programming concepts needed to interact with Chronovyan technology, establish a base of operations, and begin the search for Professor Thorne.

This act introduces the core programming concepts that form the foundation of the Chronovyan language, gradually building the player's skills from basic variable manipulation to complex function structures.

## Chapters in Act I

### Chapter 1: First Echoes in Chronovya

In this initial chapter, Alex learns to communicate with the alien world through basic programming concepts. The main focus is on understanding variables, simple data types, and basic interactions with Chronovyan objects.

**Key Concepts:**
- Variable declaration and assignment
- Basic data types (numbers, strings, booleans)
- Reading data from sensor-like objects
- Calling simple methods
- Using print_to_cora() for output

**Main Quest:** "Mapping the Safe Zone" - Activate three Wayfinder Monoliths to generate a map of the local area, establishing a safe perimeter for operations.

### Chapter 2: First Interactions

Building on the basics, this chapter introduces conditional logic, allowing Alex to make decisions based on environmental data. The challenge involves analyzing and navigating through a dangerous crystal field.

**Key Concepts:**
- Conditional statements (IF/ELSE)
- Comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=)
- Logical operators (&&, ||)
- Decision trees
- Code branching

**Main Challenge:** "The Crystal Pathway" - Program a wrist device to identify safe and unsafe crystals based on their temperature properties.

### Chapter 3: Repeating Patterns

This chapter introduces loop structures, enabling Alex to perform repetitive tasks efficiently. The challenge involves repairing an ancient terminal stuck in an initialization loop.

**Key Concepts:**
- WHILE loops for condition-based repetition
- FOR loops for counting and iteration
- Loop control variables
- Termination conditions
- Avoiding infinite loops

**Main Challenge:** "The Ancient Terminal" - Fix a malfunctioning terminal by properly implementing loop structures to send the correct sequence of activation signals.

### Chapter 4: Functional Fragments

Functions and modularization are the focus of this chapter, as Alex learns to organize code into reusable components. The challenge involves decoding a data crystal by restructuring fragmented code.

**Key Concepts:**
- Function definition with the func keyword
- Parameter passing and type annotations
- Return values
- Function calling
- Code organization and reusability
- Function hierarchies

**Main Challenge:** "The Data Crystal" - Organize scattered code fragments into proper functions to decode a data crystal containing crucial information.

### Chapter 5: Stabilizing CORA's Power Core

The culminating challenge of Act I integrates all previously learned concepts. Alex must stabilize a Temporal Core facility to restore CORA's full functionality and establish a base of operations.

**Key Concepts:**
- Integration of variables, conditionals, loops, and functions
- Complex problem-solving
- Algorithm development
- Debugging and troubleshooting
- Working with interconnected systems

**Main Quest:** "Core Stabilization" - Complete the missing portions of the Core stabilization protocol to balance energy flow, temporal synchronization, and stability regulation.

## Learning Path Progression

Act I follows a carefully structured learning path:
1. **Data & Information** (Chapter 1): Understanding how to store and manipulate data
2. **Decision Making** (Chapter 2): Learning to make choices based on conditions
3. **Repetition** (Chapter 3): Performing tasks multiple times with loops
4. **Organization** (Chapter 4): Structuring code into modular, reusable functions
5. **Integration** (Chapter 5): Combining all concepts to solve complex problems

By the end of Act I, players will have mastered the fundamental programming concepts of Chronovyan and be prepared for the more advanced techniques introduced in Act II.

## Next Steps

With CORA's full functionality restored and a safe base of operations established, Alex is ready to venture forth in search of Professor Thorne. The journey to the Central Observatory will take them through various Fracture Zones, each requiring more advanced programming techniques.
