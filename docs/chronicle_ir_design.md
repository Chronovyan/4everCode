# Chronovyan Intermediate Representation (IR) Design



## 1. Introduction



The Chronovyan Intermediate Representation (ChronIR) is a crucial component of the Chronicle Compiler, serving as the bridge between the high-level AST and the lower-level bytecode or native code. This document details the design of ChronIR, focusing on its structure, temporal semantics, and optimization opportunities.



ChronIR is specifically designed to represent the unique aspects of Chronovyan code, including temporal operations, resource management, and CONF/REB variable interactions. It provides a foundation for sophisticated temporal and resource-aware optimizations that would be difficult or impossible to implement at the AST level or during runtime.



## 2. Design Goals



### 2.1 Primary Goals

- Represent all Chronovyan language constructs in a format conducive to analysis and optimization

- Capture temporal relationships between operations

- Represent resource usage and flow

- Support static detection of paradoxes and inconsistencies

- Enable advanced optimizations specific to temporal programming



### 2.2 Secondary Goals

- Facilitate efficient code generation for multiple targets

- Support debugging information

- Enable incremental compilation

- Allow for serialization and deserialization for multi-pass compilation

- Maintain sufficient high-level information for meaningful error messages



## 3. IR Structure



ChronIR is structured as a graph-based representation with multiple interconnected components:



### 3.1 Core Components



#### 3.1.1 Instructions

The basic units of computation in ChronIR are instructions, which represent atomic operations such as:

- Arithmetic operations

- Variable assignments

- Resource expenditure

- Temporal operations (branch, merge, rewind)

- Function calls



Each instruction is annotated with:

- Resource costs (Chronons, Aethel)

- Temporal effects (timeline branches, merges)

- CONF/REB classification

- Source location (for debugging)



#### 3.1.2 Basic Blocks

Instructions are grouped into basic blocks, which are sequences of instructions with:

- A single entry point (at the beginning)

- A single exit point (at the end)

- No internal branches or labels



Basic blocks form the nodes in the control flow graph.



#### 3.1.3 Control Flow Graph (CFG)

The CFG represents the flow of execution between basic blocks. In Chronovyan, the CFG is extended to represent temporal relationships:

- Standard edges for sequential flow

- Temporal edges for timeline branches and merges

- Rewind edges for temporal loops

- Paradox potential markers on cycles that might cause paradoxes



#### 3.1.4 Temporal Flow Graph (TFG)

The TFG is a special graph overlaid on the CFG that represents the flow of temporal operations:

- Timeline creation and destruction

- Timeline branching and merging

- Resource flow between timelines

- Causality chains



#### 3.1.5 Data Dependency Graph (DDG)

The DDG captures dependencies between variables and operations:

- Read-after-write dependencies

- Write-after-read dependencies

- Write-after-write dependencies

- CONF/REB interactions (potential paradox points)



#### 3.1.6 Resource Flow Graph (RFG)

The RFG tracks the flow of resources (Chronons, Aethel) throughout the program:

- Resource allocation points

- Resource consumption points

- Resource optimization opportunities

- Temporal debt creation and repayment



### 3.2 IR Type System



ChronIR includes a rich type system that preserves the semantics of Chronovyan types:



#### 3.2.1 Basic Types

- Primitives (integer, float, boolean, string)

- Temporal types (Chronon, Aethel)

- CONF/REB modifiers for all types

- Variable flags (::STATIC, ::VOLATILE, ::ANCHOR, ::WEAVER)



#### 3.2.2 Complex Types

- Vector type with temporal semantics

- Map type with key versioning

- Temporal sequences

- User-defined types

- Function types



#### 3.2.3 Type Annotations

All types in ChronIR are annotated with:

- Temporal properties (stability, paradox potential)

- Resource usage patterns

- CONF/REB classification

- Optimization hints

## 10. Conclusion



The Chronovyan Intermediate Representation (ChronIR) is a powerful foundation for the Chronicle Compiler, enabling sophisticated analysis and optimization of Chronovyan code. Its unique design captures the temporal semantics, resource management, and CONF/REB interactions that are central to the Chronovyan programming model.



By providing a rich set of instructions, annotations, and graph representations, ChronIR facilitates the development of temporal-aware optimizations that would be difficult or impossible to implement at other stages of compilation. This will allow the Chronicle Compiler to generate highly efficient code that makes optimal use of temporal resources while maintaining the semantics and safety guarantees of the Chronovyan language.



As the Chronicle Compiler project progresses, ChronIR will continue to evolve to support new language features, optimization techniques, and target platforms. Its flexible design provides a solid foundation for these future developments while meeting the immediate needs of the compiler implementation.
