# Chronovyan Test Coverage Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the current test coverage for the Chronovyan language implementation and identifies areas for future testing expansion. Testing is essential to ensure the stability, correctness, and performance of the Chronovyan system, particularly given its complex temporal semantics and resource management features.

## Current Test Status

### Passing Tests

1. **Ultra Minimal Tests** (`ultra_minimal_test.exe`)
   - **Status**: ✅ All 5 tests passing
   - **Coverage**: Core resource management and environment functionality
     - `ResourceLevels`: Testing basic resource level management
     - `ResourceAvailability`: Verifying resource availability checks
     - `ResourceExpenditure`: Testing resource consumption
     - `VariableManagement`: Testing variable definition and retrieval
     - `EnclosingEnvironments`: Testing environment hierarchy

2. **Basic Environment Tests** (`basic_env_test.exe`)
   - **Status**: ✅ All 2 tests passing
   - **Coverage**: Basic assertion functionality
     - `SimpleAssert`: Testing basic equality assertions
     - `BooleanAssertions`: Testing boolean assertions

### Tests With Issues

1. **Resource Optimization Tests** (`resource_optimization_test.cpp`)
   - **Status**: ❌ Linking errors
   - **Issues**: 
     - Missing implementations for `ResourceOptimizer` methods
     - Missing implementations for `ResourceVisualization` methods
     - Missing implementations for `TemporalDebtTracker` methods
     - Missing constructor implementations

2. **Simple Environment Tests** (`simple_env_test.cpp`)
   - **Status**: ❌ Linking errors
   - **Issues**:
     - Same linking issues as resource optimization tests

3. **Minimal Environment Tests** (`minimal_env_test.cpp`)
   - **Status**: ❌ Linking errors
   - **Issues**:
     - Missing `SourceLocation` implementation
     - Missing `ErrorHandler` methods
     - Interpreter method dependencies

## Vector Type Integration

The VECTOR type has been successfully integrated into the Chronovyan type system:

1. **Integration Method**:
   - Added registration calls in the Interpreter constructor
   - Included proper header files for vector types
   - Registered both standard vector and multi-dimensional vector types

2. **Vector Functionality**:
   - Standard vector operations (push_back, pop_back, etc.)
   - Mapping, filtering, and reduction functions
   - Sorting and searching capabilities
   - Temporal features for historical state tracking

3. **Resource Tracking**:
   - Operations track resource usage via the temporal runtime
   - Resource costs scale based on operation complexity and vector size

## Testing Gaps and Future Requirements

### Short-term Testing Priorities

1. **Fix Linking Errors**:
   - Implement missing resource management functions
   - Complete implementations for visualizations
   - Add missing method implementations for temporal debt tracking

2. **Vector Type Testing**:
   - Create dedicated test suite for vector operations
   - Test temporal features of vectors
   - Verify resource tracking for vector operations

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test interaction between environment and vector types
   - Verify custom type system registration process
   - Test vector operations within Chronovyan scripts

### Medium-term Testing Requirements

1. **Temporal Mechanics Testing**:
   - Timeline branching and merging
   - State preservation across temporal operations
   - Paradox detection and handling

2. **Resource Management Testing**:
   - Long-running resource consumption patterns
   - Resource optimization effectiveness
   - Temporal debt accrual and repayment

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Vector operation performance with large datasets
   - Resource tracking overhead
   - Memory usage patterns

### Long-term Testing Vision

1. **Comprehensive Test Suite**:
   - Complete coverage of all language features
   - Extensive edge case testing
   - Integration with CI/CD pipeline

2. **Automated Stress Testing**:
   - Long-running stability tests
   - Resource leak detection
   - Performance degradation analysis

3. **User Scenario Testing**:
   - Common usage patterns
   - Real-world application simulations
   - Cross-platform compatibility

## Conclusion

While basic test infrastructure is in place and core functionality tests are passing, significant work remains to achieve comprehensive test coverage. The immediate focus should be on fixing linking errors and implementing missing functionality to enable the execution of existing test suites. Following that, dedicated testing for vector types and other advanced features should be prioritized.

Testing is particularly important for Chronovyan due to its unique temporal features and resource management model, which introduce complexities not present in traditional programming languages.
