# Temporal Timeline

The `Timeline` class is a core component of the [Chronovyan](https://chronovyan.github.io) framework that provides a thread-safe way to manage and query temporal events and synchronization points. It's designed to work in conjunction with the `TemporalSynchronizer` to provide a complete temporal programming solution.

## Features

- **Thread-Safe Operations**: All public methods are thread-safe and can be called from multiple threads concurrently.
- **Temporal Ordering**: Automatically maintains events in chronological order.
- **Efficient Querying**: Quickly retrieve the most recent events or sync points.
- **Global Event Logging**: Track system-wide events with the `TimelineManager`.

## Components

### Timeline

The main class for managing a sequence of temporal events. Each timeline maintains its own sequence of sync points.

### TimelineManager

Manages multiple named timelines and provides a global event log for system-wide events.

### TimelineEvent

Represents an event in the timeline with a timestamp and optional metadata.
