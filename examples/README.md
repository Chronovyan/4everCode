# Chronovyan Language Examples

This directory contains example programs for the Chronovyan language, organized by difficulty level and concept.

## Directory Structure

- **[01_beginner](01_beginner/)** - Basic examples for beginners
- **[02_intermediate](02_intermediate/)** - Intermediate examples that build upon basic concepts
- **[03_advanced](03_advanced/)** - Advanced examples demonstrating complex features and applications

## Learning Path

For the best learning experience, we recommend following this path:

1. Start with the **01_beginner** examples to learn the basic syntax and concepts
2. Move to the **02_intermediate** examples to understand more advanced features
3. Explore the **03_advanced** examples to see complex applications and algorithms

## Running the Examples

To run any example, use the Chronovyan interpreter:

```bash
chronovyan examples/01_beginner/01_hello_world.cvy
```

## Example Categories

### Beginner Examples (01_beginner)
- Hello World programs
- Basic syntax demonstrations
- Simple variable usage
- Basic control flow

### Intermediate Examples (02_intermediate)
