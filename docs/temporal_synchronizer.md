# Temporal Synchronizer

The `TemporalSynchronizer` class provides a mechanism for synchronizing temporal flows in a multi-threaded environment. It allows for the coordination of asynchronous operations while maintaining metrics about the synchronization process.

## Features

- **Thread-safe**: All operations are thread-safe and can be called from multiple threads.
- **Asynchronous Operation**: Uses a background thread to perform synchronization tasks.
- **Metrics Tracking**: Tracks synchronization metrics including overall sync, stability, and coherence.
- **Callback Support**: Provides a callback mechanism to be notified when synchronization completes.

## Usage

```cpp
#include <4ever/temporal_synchronizer_simple.hpp>

using namespace 4ever::sync;

// Create a new TemporalSynchronizer
TemporalSynchronizer sync;

// Set a callback to be notified when synchronization completes
sync.set_sync_callback([](double progress) {
    if (progress >= 1.0) {
        std::cout << "Synchronization complete!" << std::endl;
    }
});

// Trigger a synchronization
sync.synchronize_temporal_flows();

// Get current metrics
double sync = sync.get_overall_sync();
double stability = sync.get_overall_stability();
double coherence = sync.get_overall_coherence();

// Clean up (automatically called in destructor)
sync.stop();
```

## Building

The TemporalSynchronizer is built as part of the main 4ever project. To build it:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Testing

To run the tests:

```bash
cd test
./build_and_run_tests.ps1
```

## Dependencies

- C++20 or later
- Thread support library
- Google Test (for testing)
