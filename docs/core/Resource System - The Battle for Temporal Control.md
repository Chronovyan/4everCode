# Resource System: The Battle for Temporal Control

## Overview
The Resource System in Chronovyan is a sophisticated framework designed to manage temporal resources efficiently. It provides mechanisms to allocate, track, and release resources in a time-aware manner, ensuring optimal performance and preventing resource leaks.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Resource Types
- **Temporal Resources**: Resources that exist within a specific time frame
- **Persistent Resources**: Resources that persist across time frames
- **Shared Resources**: Resources that can be accessed by multiple temporal contexts

### 2. Resource Management

#### 2.1 Allocation
```cpp
// Example of resource allocation
auto resource = ResourceManager::allocate("temporal_buffer", 1024);
```

#### 2.2 Deallocation
```cpp
// Resource cleanup is handled automatically when out of scope
// or can be explicitly released
resource.release();
```

### 3. Advanced Features

#### 3.1 Resource Pools
```cpp
// Create a pool of resources
ResourcePool<Buffer> buffer_pool(10);

// Get a resource from the pool
auto buffer = buffer_pool.acquire();

// Use the buffer...

// Return to pool when done
buffer_pool.release(std::move(buffer));
```

#### 3.2 Thread Safety
All resource operations are thread-safe by default, using fine-grained locking to minimize contention.

## Best Practices

1. **RAII Pattern**: Always use RAII wrappers for resource management
2. **Resource Pools**: Use pools for frequently allocated resources
3. **Early Release**: Release resources as soon as they're no longer needed
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor resource usage to detect leaks or inefficiencies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Resource Leaks
- **Symptom**: Increasing memory usage over time
- **Solution**: Ensure all resources are properly released or managed by RAII wrappers

#### Contention
- **Symptom**: Performance degradation under high concurrency
- **Solution**: Use finer-grained locking or consider lock-free alternatives
