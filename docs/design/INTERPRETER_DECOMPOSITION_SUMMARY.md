# Interpreter Decomposition Summary (WS-2023-07-001)


## Accomplished Tasks

1. **Created Visitor Component Architecture**
   - Designed a modular architecture for the interpreter with separate visitor components
   - Implemented four main components:
     - ExpressionVisitor: Handles evaluation of expression nodes
     - StatementVisitor: Manages execution of statement nodes including control flow
     - TemporalVisitor: Specializes in temporal operations
     - ResourceManager: Dedicated component for resource tracking and optimization


2. **Implemented Component Headers and Implementations**
   - Created well-documented header files for each component
   - Implemented the core functionality in corresponding .cpp files
   - Ensured proper separation of concerns between components

3. **Created Unit Tests**
   - Developed comprehensive unit tests for each visitor component
   - Implemented test cases covering edge cases and normal operation
   - Created integration tests to verify component interaction


4. **Updated Interpreter Class**
   - Modified the Interpreter class to use the new visitor components
   - Updated constructor to initialize component instances
   - Implemented delegation methods to route calls to appropriate components

5. **Fixed Initial Compilation Issues**
   - Resolved VariableModifier enum redefinition by moving it to a dedicated header
   - Created missing chron_types.h file to define temporal types needed by the codebase


## Remaining Tasks

1. **Resolve Compilation Errors**
   - Implement missing helper methods for binary operations (add, subtract, etc.)
   - Implement missing helper methods for unary operations (negate, logicalNot)
   - Fix issues with comparison operations (areEqual, etc.)
   - Address issues with ChronovyanFunction class used in function declarations
   - Fix member access issues with EnumVariant class


2. **Fix UserTypeSystem Issues**
   - Address incomplete type definitions
   - Fix mismatched declarations in methods
   - Ensure proper initialization of member variables

3. **Complete Integration**
   - Ensure all interpreter functionality is properly delegated to visitor components
   - Verify resource management is correctly handled by the ResourceManager
   - Check that temporal operations are properly delegated to TemporalVisitor


4. **Testing**
   - Complete unit testing of all components
   - Run integration tests to verify component interaction
   - Execute existing interpreter tests to ensure compatibility

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Measure performance impact of the refactoring
   - Optimize critical paths as needed
   - Ensure resource utilization is efficient


## Next Steps

1. Focus on fixing the compilation errors to get a working build
2. Address each remaining issue in order of priority
3. Complete testing to ensure full functionality
4. Document the new architecture and component interactions
