# The Chronolog of Dissonance

*This sacred scroll serves as the official record of all known temporal instabilities, paradoxes, and dissonances encountered within the Weaves of Chronovya. Let each entry guide the Menders towards restoring Harmony and Order to the Grand Tapestry of Time.*

## Structure of Dissonance Records

Each temporal anomaly shall be recorded with the following attributes:

## Active Dissonances

### CD-2025-05-001
- **Title:** CORA's optical sensor flickers erratically when processing `REWIND_FLOW` loops
- **Reported By:** Overseer
- **Date Observed:** 2025-05-15
- **Perceived Severity:** Major Dissonance
- **Current Status:** Resonating
- **Detailed Description:**  
  CORA's optical sensor visualization component displays erratic flickering when processing temporal code containing nested `REWIND_FLOW` loops. The flickering occurs approximately 2.5 seconds after the inner loop begins execution and continues until the outer loop completes its cycle.
  
  Steps to reproduce:
  1. Initialize CORA with default visualization settings
  2. Execute any Chronoscript containing at least 3 levels of nested `REWIND_FLOW` loops
  3. Observe the optical sensor display during the inner loop execution
  
  Error message in console: `WARNING: Temporal rendering buffer overflow at index 0x7FE3A2C1. Unstable flux detected.`
  
- **Affected Weave(s) / Module(s):** 
  - `src/visualization/cora_optical_renderer.cpp`
  - `include/cora/sensor_array.h`
  - Possibly the `TemporalBufferManager` class
  
- **Assigned Weaver:** Cursor
- **Mending Glyphs & Chronal Notes:** *Pending*
- **Date Harmony Restored:** *Pending*
- **Verification Method:** *Pending*

### CD-2025-05-002
- **Title:** Whispering Stone provides `null` pressure reading after temporal surge event
- **Reported By:** CORA
- **Date Observed:** 2025-05-18
- **Perceived Severity:** Minor Flux
- **Current Status:** Mending in Progress
- **Detailed Description:**  
  The Whispering Stone sensor consistently returns `null` pressure readings after any temporal surge event with magnitude greater than 3.7 on the Chronal Scale. The sensor appears to enter a dormant state requiring a full system reboot to restore functionality.
  
  Steps to reproduce:
  1. Initialize 4ever runtime with attached Whispering Stone sensor
  2. Generate a temporal surge event with magnitude > 3.7 (using the `SURGE_TEMPORAL_FLOW` command with appropriate parameters)
  3. Attempt to read pressure values from the Whispering Stone
  4. Observe `null` values returned despite sensor being physically functional
  
  No error messages are generated, but the diagnostic log shows: `WHISPERING_STONE_SENSOR: state=READY` even when the sensor is unresponsive.
  
- **Affected Weave(s) / Module(s):** 
  - `src/sensors/whispering_stone.cpp`
  - `include/sensors/pressure_interface.h`
  - `src/chronometry/surge_handler.cpp`
  
- **Assigned Weaver:** Alex
- **Mending Glyphs & Chronal Notes:**  
  Initial investigation reveals that the sensor's internal buffer is not being properly cleared after a surge event. The `resetAfterSurge()` method in `WhisperingStoneSensor` class is being called, but the internal state remains corrupted.
  
  Working on implementing a more robust reset procedure that properly reinitializes all internal buffers and state variables.
  
- **Date Harmony Restored:** *Pending*
- **Verification Method:** *Pending*

## Resolved Dissonances

*When temporal paradoxes are mended, their records shall be moved to this section.*

### CD-2025-05-002
- **Title:** Whispering Stone provides `null` pressure reading after temporal surge event
- **Reported By:** CORA
- **Date Observed:** 2025-05-18
- **Perceived Severity:** Minor Flux
- **Current Status:** Harmony Restored
- **Detailed Description:**  
  The Whispering Stone sensor consistently returns `null` pressure readings after any temporal surge event with magnitude greater than 3.7 on the Chronal Scale. The sensor appears to enter a dormant state requiring a full system reboot to restore functionality.
  
  Steps to reproduce:
  1. Initialize 4ever runtime with attached Whispering Stone sensor
  2. Generate a temporal surge event with magnitude > 3.7 (using the `SURGE_TEMPORAL_FLOW` command with appropriate parameters)
  3. Attempt to read pressure values from the Whispering Stone
  4. Observe `null` values returned despite sensor being physically functional
  
  No error messages are generated, but the diagnostic log shows: `WHISPERING_STONE_SENSOR: state=READY` even when the sensor is unresponsive.
  
- **Affected Weave(s) / Module(s):** 
  - `src/sensors/whispering_stone.cpp`
  - `include/sensors/pressure_interface.h`
  - `src/chronometry/surge_handler.cpp`
  
- **Assigned Weaver:** Cursor
- **Mending Glyphs & Chronal Notes:**  
  The dissonance was caused by an incomplete reset procedure in the `WhisperingStoneSensor::resetAfterSurge()` method, which updated the sensor's state flag to `READY` without properly reinitializing internal buffers and validating functionality after high-magnitude temporal surges.

  The fix implemented several key improvements:
  1. Enhanced the `resetAfterSurge()` method to perform a comprehensive reset of all internal buffers, pointers, and state variables
  2. Added proper validation through a new `performSelfTest()` method to confirm sensor functionality before reporting `READY` state
  3. Implemented a retry mechanism in the `SurgeHandler` to attempt recovery multiple times before requiring maintenance
  4. Added better error reporting to correctly reflect the sensor's actual state
  5. Created a maintenance flagging system to avoid requiring full system reboots

  The implementation included:
  - Creating a complete buffer management system with validation
  - Adding proper state tracking with appropriate error handling
  - Implementing a comprehensive self-test mechanism that verifies both hardware functionality and buffer integrity
  - Adding detailed logging to facilitate diagnostics and monitoring
  - Creating a retry mechanism with appropriate timeouts to handle intermittent issues

  These changes ensure the Whispering Stone sensor properly recovers after temporal surges of any magnitude and accurately reports its operational status.
  
- **Date Harmony Restored:** 2025-05-28
- **Verification Method:**  
  The fix was verified through a comprehensive test suite that:
  1. Executed tests with temporal surges of varying magnitudes (3.5, 3.7, 3.8, 4.0, 4.2, 4.4)
  2. Confirmed pressure readings remain valid after surges above the 3.7 threshold
  3. Verified the sensor correctly reports its state in diagnostic logs
  4. Tested rapid succession of multiple surge events to ensure sustained recovery capability
  5. Confirmed no system reboots are required to restore functionality
  
  All tests passed successfully, with the sensor maintaining valid readings after all surge magnitudes, including those above the previous failure threshold of 3.7. The logs correctly reported the sensor's state throughout the process, and multiple rapid surges were handled properly without requiring a system reboot.

## Guidelines for Scribing a New Dissonance

When a new anomaly is perceived within the 4ever tapestry, follow these sacred procedures:

1. Assign the next sequential Dissonance ID based on the current year, month, and order of discovery
2. Ensure all fields are detailed meticulously to aid the Menders in their sacred work
3. Update the "Harmonic State" as the mending progresses through its natural cycles
4. Once Harmony is Restored, the Mending Glyphs and Attunement Confirmation must be fully chronicled
5. Move resolved dissonances from the "Active Dissonances" section to the "Resolved Dissonances" section
6. Maintain the chronological order within each section, with newest entries at the top
