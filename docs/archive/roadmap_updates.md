# Roadmap Updates for Enhanced Temporal Control Flow

## REWIND_FLOW Enhancements - Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundations (Designed and Documented)
- ✅ Design enhanced REWIND_FLOW control mechanisms
  - ✅ HALT_REWIND
  - ✅ STABILIZE_TIMELINE
  - ✅ PREVENT_MODIFICATION
- ✅ Document control mechanism behavior and resource consumption
- ✅ Create language reference documentation
- ✅ Create test cases for validation

### Phase 2: AST and Parser Integration
- ⬜ Fix AST node structure issues:
  - ⬜ Resolve duplicate visitor method declarations
  - ⬜ Standardize method signatures (const consistency)
  - ⬜ Update forward declarations
- ⬜ Implement control token definitions
- ⬜ Implement parsing logic for control mechanisms
- ⬜ Update parser validation tests

### Phase 3: Interpreter Implementation
- ⬜ Implement control flag management
- ⬜ Implement resource tracking for control mechanisms
- ⬜ Implement visitor methods for control statements
- ⬜ Update REWIND_FLOW implementation to use control flags

- ⬜ Test error handling and edge cases
- ⬜ Performance testing and optimization

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- ⬜ Implement scope control for PREVENT_MODIFICATION
  - ⬜ Local scope (current block only)
  - ⬜ Global scope (entire execution)
  - ⬜ Timeline scope (specific timeline only)
- ⬜ Implement adaptive stabilization for STABILIZE_TIMELINE
  - ⬜ Auto-adjust intensity based on paradox risk
  - ⬜ Resource optimization for stabilization
