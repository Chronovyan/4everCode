# The Weaver's Archive: Directory Structure

## The Temporal Atlas

Greetings, Navigator of the 4ever Archives! This scroll maps the physical manifestation of our knowledge, organizing the sacred texts into a structure that reflects both logical order and philosophical meaning. Like the branching timelines of Chronos Prime, our directory structure flows from foundational concepts to specific implementations, guiding Weavers of all castes through the repository.

**Purpose**: This document outlines the recommended organization of the 4ever project files, helping contributors locate existing documents and place new ones appropriately within the established hierarchy.

**Lore Tidbit**: The Archive Keepers of the Anchor Caste maintain a crystalline matrix of temporal threads, each representing a document in the 4ever Codex. The physical organization of this matrix—mirrored in our directory structure—is said to influence the stability of the knowledge itself.

## Root Directory: `/4ever`

The root of all temporal threads, containing the highest-level navigation documents:

```
/4ever
├── README.md                       # The entry point for all travelers
├── ROADMAP.md                      # The temporal map of past and future development
├── CHANGELOG.md                    # The chronicle of changes across versions
└── docs/                           # The main repository of knowledge
```

## The Knowledge Repository: `/4ever/docs`

The central archive containing all documentation, organized by purpose and caste:

```
/4ever/docs
├── 4ever_Documentation_Index.md   # The master index of all documentation
├── Directory_Structure.md              # This navigational guide
├── 4ever_Manifesto.md             # The foundational philosophy document
│
├── philosophy/                     # Foundational philosophical concepts
│   ├── The_Great_Duality_Order_and_Flux.md
│   └── Programming_as_Temporal_Weaving.md
│
├── specifications/                 # Technical specifications (Anchor domain)
│   ├── 4ever_Formal_Grammar.md
│   ├── 4ever_Runtime_Semantics.md
│   ├── 4ever_Data_Types.md
│   ├── 4ever_Variable_Interaction_Rules.md
│   └── 4ever_Loop_Stability_Metrics.md

│   ├── Chronoscript_Lore_and_Narrative_Guide.md
│   ├── Chronoscript_Language_Specification.md
│   ├── Chronoscript_Standard_Library_Reference.md
│   └── Chronoscript_Runtime_Mechanics_Guide.md
│
├── phase_summaries/               # Chronicles of completed phases
│   ├── Phase_1_Completion_Summary.md
│   └── Phase_2_Completion_Summary.md
│
├── implementation/                # Phase 3 implementation guides (future)
│   └── [Reserved for future documents]
│
└── TECHNICAL_DEBT.md              # Record of issues requiring future attention
```

## Suggested Organization of New Documents

When adding new scrolls to the Archive, follow these guidelines:

### For the Anchor Caste (Order-Focused)

Technical specifications, formal definitions, and implementation details belong in:
- `/4ever/docs/specifications/` for language definitions
- `/4ever/docs/implementation/` for reference implementation details

### For the Seeker Caste (Flux-Focused)

Narrative guides, lore expansions, and creative explorations belong in:
- `/4ever/docs/narrative/` for lore-rich guides
- `/4ever/docs/philosophy/` for new philosophical concepts

### For the Rebel Weaver Caste (Balanced)

Integration documents, summaries, and user-focused content belong in:
- `/4ever/docs/` (root) for major indices and overviews
- `/4ever/docs/phase_summaries/` for milestone documentation

## Migration Guide

To align with this structure, we recommend the following relocations:

1. Move all Chronoscript narrative guides from `/docs/` to `/docs/narrative/`
2. Ensure all technical specifications are consolidated in `/docs/specifications/`
3. Create the `/docs/philosophy/` directory if it doesn't exist, and move relevant documents there
4. Update cross-references in all documents to reflect the new paths

## Timeline Integration

This structure is designed to evolve with the 4ever project. As we progress through Phase 3 and beyond, new directories may emerge to accommodate implementation artifacts, testing frameworks, and community contributions.

**Lore Tidbit**: The Archive structure itself is said to be a temporal program, with directories as WEAVE_PATTERNs and files as temporal operations. Maintaining its harmony is as important as the content it contains, for a fractured Archive can lead to a fractured understanding.

# 4ever Documentation Directory Structure

> **Version**: 1.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2023-10-15

This document provides an overview of the 4ever documentation structure, explaining the organization of the docs directory and what information can be found where.

## Primary Documentation Files

The 4ever documentation is consolidated into three main files, each serving a different purpose:

1. **[Implementation Guide](./implementation_guide.md)**: A comprehensive guide for developers implementing or working with 4ever. Includes getting started instructions, development roadmap, core components overview, implementation examples, development guidelines, and troubleshooting information.

2. **[API Reference](./api_reference.md)**: Detailed technical documentation of all 4ever components, classes, methods, and types. Includes resource management, temporal debt, resource visualization, and core types documentation.

3. **[AI Assistant Guide](./ai_assistant_guide.md)**: Specialized guide for AI assistants working with the codebase. Includes quick reference information, codebase navigation guidance, and common implementation tasks.

## Documentation Index and Metadata

- **[4ever_Documentation_Index.md](./4ever_Documentation_Index.md)**: The master index for all documentation, providing an overview of the documentation organization and narrative context.

- **[DOCUMENTATION_METADATA.md](./DOCUMENTATION_METADATA.md)**: Tracks which original documentation files have been consolidated into the three main files, along with their status and consolidation notes.

## Specialized Documentation Directories

The docs directory contains several subdirectories with specialized documentation:

- **advanced/**: Deep-dive technical documentation on advanced features and concepts
  - **error_handling/**: Advanced error handling and recovery strategies
  - **integration_features/**: Integration with other systems and advanced features
  - **resource_management/**: Advanced resource management techniques

## Additional Documentation Files

Several standalone documentation files exist in the docs directory:

- **CHANGELOG.md**: Record of changes to the project
- **4E_File_Format.md**: Specification of the CVY file format
- **ML_Model_Paths.md**: Documentation on machine learning model paths
- **README.md**: Overview of the docs directory
- **TECHNICAL_DEBT.md**: Documentation of technical debt
- **TECH_DEBT_*.md**: Various technical debt documentation files

## Documentation Relationships

The documentation is organized hierarchically:

1. **README.md** (in root directory) serves as the entry point, directing users to the three main documentation files.

2. The three main documentation files (**Implementation Guide**, **API Reference**, and **AI Assistant Guide**) provide comprehensive information for their respective purposes.

3. The **4ever_Documentation_Index.md** provides a narrative overview of the documentation organization.

4. Specialized directories and files provide more detailed information on specific topics.

## Consolidated vs. Original Documentation

As part of the documentation consolidation effort:

1. The three main documentation files contain the most up-to-date and comprehensive information.

2. Some original documentation files in specialized directories may contain duplicate or older information that has been consolidated.

3. The **DOCUMENTATION_METADATA.md** file tracks which original files have been consolidated and their status.

4. Some specialized documentation (like formal specifications) remains separate from the consolidated files but is referenced by them.

## Recommended Documentation Flow

For new users and developers, the recommended documentation flow is:

1. Start with the **README.md** in the root directory.
2. Based on your needs, proceed to one of the three main documentation files.
3. Use the **4ever_Documentation_Index.md** for narrative context and organization.
4. Refer to specialized documentation in subdirectories as needed for deeper understanding of specific topics.
