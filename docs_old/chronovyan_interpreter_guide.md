# Chronovyan Interpreter Guide

> *"Every timeline needs its translator, every temporal pattern its interpreter."*  
> â€” Chronovyan Axiom of Computational Clarity

## Introduction

The Chronovyan interpreter is a comprehensive implementation that executes Chronovyan programs according to the complete language specification as defined in the Chronovyan Language Guide series (Act II Primer, Advanced Mechanics Addendum, and Reference Supplement).

## Interpreter Features

The Chronovyan interpreter supports:

- **Complete Language Specification**: All syntax and features described in the language documentation
- **Resource Management**: Full tracking and visualization of Aethel and Chronons
- **Temporal Runtime**: Manages timeline flow and temporal operations
- **Paradox Detection**: Identifies and reports paradoxical code patterns
- **Temporal Debt Tracking**: Monitors and visualizes accumulated temporal debt
- **Type System**: Comprehensive support for all Chronovyan types including primitive, composite, and user-defined types
- **Interface-Based Design**: Full implementation of interfaces and structures
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error reporting with location information
- **AST-Based Execution**: Proper semantic analysis via abstract syntax tree

## Command Line Usage

```bash
chronovyan_interpreter [options] <filename.cvy>

Options:
  --help                  Show help message
  --verbose               Enable verbose output
  --no-visualize          Disable resource visualization
  --show-tokens           Show lexer tokens
  --show-ast              Show abstract syntax tree
  --debug                 Enable debug mode
```

## Implementation Architecture

The interpreter is built on the following components:

1. **Lexer** (`lexer.h/cpp`): Tokenizes source code
2. **Parser** (`parser.h/cpp`): Builds AST from tokens
3. **AST Nodes** (`ast_nodes.h`): Defines syntax tree structures
4. **Interpreter** (`interpreter.h/cpp`): Executes AST nodes
5. **Environment** (`environment.h/cpp`): Manages variable scopes
6. **Value** (`value.h/cpp`): Represents runtime values
7. **Temporal Runtime** (`temporal_runtime.h/cpp`): Manages temporal resources
8. **Resource Visualization** (`resource_visualization.h/cpp`): Visualizes resource usage

The implementation follows a standard interpreter pattern with visitor-based AST traversal.

## File Locations

- Main Interpreter Entry Point: `src/chronovyan_interpreter.cpp`
- Core Interpreter Implementation: `include/interpreter.h` and `src/interpreter.cpp`

## Example Usage

```bash
# Run a standard program
chronovyan_interpreter examples/01_beginner/01_hello_world.cvy

# Run with verbose output
chronovyan_interpreter --verbose examples/02_intermediate/act2_ch1_mq1_ascent_to_the_unknown_logic.cvy

# Debug mode with token and AST visualization
chronovyan_interpreter --debug --show-tokens --show-ast examples/side_quests/act2_ch1_sq1_echoes_in_the_code.cvy
```

## Execution Process

When you run the Chronovyan interpreter with a source file, it goes through the following steps:

1. **Loading**: The source file is loaded and its contents read into memory
2. **Lexical Analysis**: The source code is tokenized into lexical units
3. **Parsing**: Tokens are parsed into an abstract syntax tree (AST)
4. **Semantic Analysis**: The AST is analyzed for semantic correctness
5. **Execution**: The AST is traversed and executed
6. **Resource Visualization**: Resource usage is displayed (if enabled)

## Error Handling

The interpreter provides detailed error messages with location information when encountering issues:

- **Lexical Errors**: Problems with token recognition
- **Syntax Errors**: Issues with code structure
- **Semantic Errors**: Problems with code meaning or type errors
- **Runtime Errors**: Issues that occur during execution
- **Resource Errors**: Problems with resource allocation or depletion
- **Paradox Errors**: Issues related to temporal paradoxes

## Resource Visualization

After executing a Chronovyan program, the interpreter displays a visualization of resource usage:

```
Resource Summary:
Aethel usage: 75
Chronon usage: 120
Temporal debt: 15

Resource Visualization:
[#####################.............] Aethel  (75/100)
[########################........] Chronons (120/160)
[#####.........................] Temporal Debt (15/100)
```

This visualization helps users understand the resource consumption patterns of their programs and identify potential optimization opportunities.

## Future Development

The interpreter will continue to evolve alongside the Chronovyan language specification. Planned enhancements include:

- **Optimization**: Improved performance for resource-intensive operations
- **Debugging Tools**: Interactive debugging capabilities
- **Integration with IDEs**: Better tooling support
- **Enhanced Visualizations**: More detailed and interactive resource visualizations
- **Profiling**: Detailed performance analysis tools

## Conclusion

The Chronovyan interpreter provides a comprehensive environment for executing Chronovyan programs with full support for the language's unique temporal features and resource management concepts. As you explore the examples and write your own Chronovyan code, the interpreter will help you understand and visualize the temporal dynamics at play in your programs.
